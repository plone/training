* Learn about Editors

Topics covered:

* Many editors

Plone consists of more than 20.000 files! You need a tool to manage that. No development environment is complete without a good editor.

People pick editors themselves. Use whatever you are comfortable and productive with. These are the most used editors in the Plone community:

* `Sublime <http://www.sublimetext.com/>`_
* `PyCharm <http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>`_
* `Wing IDE <http://wingide.com/>`_
* `PyDev <http://www.pydev.org/>`_ for `Eclipse <http://www.eclipse.org/>`_
* `Aptana Studio <http://www.aptana.com/products/studio3.html>`_
* vim
* emacs
* `Textmate <http://macromates.com/>`_

Some features that most editors have in one form or another are essential when developing with Plone.

* **Find in project** (SublimeText 3: ``cmd + shift + f``)
* **Find files in Project** (SublimeText 3: ``cmd + t``)
* **Find methods and classes in Project** (SublimeText 3: ``cmd + shift + r``)
* **Goto Definition** (SublimeText3 with codeintel: ``alt + click``)
* **Powerful search & replace**

The capability of performing a *full text search* through the complete Plone code is invaluable. Thanks to omelette, an SSD and plenty of RAM you can search through the complete Plone code base in 3 seconds.

.. note::

    Some Editors/IDE's have to be extend to be fully featured. Here are some packages we recommend when using Sublime Text 3:

    * SublimeCodeIntel (Goto Definition)
    * BracketHighlighter
    * GitGutter
    * FileDiffs
    * SublimeLinter with SublimeLinter-flake8 ...
    * INI (syntax for ini-Files)
    * SideBarEnhancements
    * MacTerminal
    * SyncedSideBar
