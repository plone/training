# Exercise 13: Pattern with React

```{warning}
This exercise requires a working buildout using a fork of the `collective.jstraining` package.
```

In this exercise, we will be walking through creating a pattern that uses [ReactJS](https://react.dev/).

You will be working in the `exercise13` directory of the `collective.jstraining` package.

## Add Your Pattern File

First off, in your `exercise13/static` directory, add a file named `pattern.js`.
Use this file to build your pattern.

This example will bind a React component to a pattern element:

```javascript
/* global require */

require([
  'jquery',
  'pat-base',
  'exercise13-react'
], function($, Base, R) {
  'use strict';
  /* combining bundle and pattern in same file this example */

  var D = R.DOM;


  var Exercise13Component = R.createClass({
    render: function(){
      return D.div({}, [
        D.span({}, 'Foobar rendered by exercise 9')
      ]);
    }
  });

  Base.extend({
    name: 'exercise13',
    trigger: '.pat-exercise13',
    parser: 'mockup',
    defaults: {
    },
    init: function() {
      var that = this;
      R.render(R.createElement(Exercise13Component, that.options), that.$el[0]);
    }
  });

});
```

Notice that the `init` of the pattern utilizes the React element binding syntax.

From there, React takes over and options from the pattern go into `props` for the React component.

## Register Static Resource Directory

Next, let us register the static directory we just placed our script into.
To register it, you need to add {term}`ZCML` registration for the static directory your script is in.

Add this to the `exercise13/configure.zcml` file

```xml
<plone:static
    directory="static"
    type="plone"
    name="exercise13"
    />
```

## Register Your Bundle

Registration is done exactly like the other examples:

```xml
<records prefix="plone.resources/exercise13-react"
         interface='Products.CMFPlone.interfaces.IResourceRegistry'>
  <value key="js">++plone++exercise13/react.min.js</value>
  <value key="css">
  </value>
</records>

<records prefix="plone.resources/exercise13"
         interface='Products.CMFPlone.interfaces.IResourceRegistry'>
  <value key="js">++plone++exercise13/pattern.js</value>
  <value key="css">
    <element>++plone++exercise13/pattern.less</element>
  </value>
</records>

<records prefix="plone.bundles/exercise13"
         interface='Products.CMFPlone.interfaces.IBundleRegistry'>
  <value key="resources">
    <element>exercise13</element>
  </value>
  <value key="merge_with">default</value>
  <value key="enabled">True</value>
  <value key="jscompilation">++plone++exercise13/exercise13-compiled.min.js</value>
  <value key="csscompilation">++plone++exercise13/exercise13-compiled.css</value>
  <value key="last_compilation">2016-10-04 00:00:00</value>
  <value key="stub_js_modules">
    <element>jquery</element>
    <element>pat-base</element>
  </value>
</records>
```

## Installation

At this point, we have all the files necessary to run the pattern.

1. Start up your Plone instance
2. Install the `Exercise 13` add-on

## Running

At this point, we have no compiled version of the code that we are running with so our code does nothing.

1. Go into {menuselection}`Site Setup --> Resource Registries`
2. Check {guilabel}`Development Mode`
3. Select to develop JavaScript and CSS for the `exercise13` bundle
4. Click {guilabel}`save`

This should load your JavaScript and LESS files now.
However, we do not have any elements with the `pat-exercise13` class assigned to them.

It is up to you how to apply the pattern class to an element of your choice.
A couple options available to you are:

1. use TinyMCE source view and add `class="pat-exercise13"` onto any tag
2. customize the theme on your site and add it to an element in your theme file or use a diazo rule to dynamically add the class to an element.

## Production

To build our bundle, we will utilize the `plone-compile-resources` script that ships with Plone.

```{warning}
If you are not running a ZEO setup, you will need to shut down your Plone instance since the ZODB in this mode does not allow multiple processes to access it at the same time.
```

An example command will look like this:

```shell
./bin/plone-compile-resources --site-id=Plone --bundle=exercise13
```

Once this command finishes, your bundle is built and will be deployed with your package.
