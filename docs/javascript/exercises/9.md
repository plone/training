# Exercise 9: Overriding a pattern TTW

```{warning}
This exercise requires a working buildout using a fork of the `collective.jstraining` package.
```

In this exercise we will be overriding a pattern through the web.

You will be working in the `exercise9` directory of the `collective.jstraining` package.

```{note}
Overriding resources through the web is limited to resources using the `++plone++` namespace.
For more information read <https://5.docs.plone.org/adapt-and-extend/theming/resourceregistry.html#the-plone-traversal-namespace>
```

## Installation

In this exercise, we will first run the installation

1. Start up your Plone instance
2. Install the `Exercise 9` add-on

## Try current pattern

Add a new page, and using the source code editor add a `<p>` element with the `exercise9` pattern

```xml
<p class="pat-exercise9">test</p>
```

After saving, you should see `test Exercise 9 was here`

## Choose the pattern to override

Go to the Site Setup, then to the Resource Registries.

Under the `Overrides` tab, pick `++plone++exercise9/pattern.js`.

Now modify the line:

```xml
that.$el.append(' <span>Exercise 9 was here</span>');
```

To be

```xml
that.$el.append(' <span>Exercise 9 has been overridden</span>');
```

## Recompile bundle

Go back to the `Registry` tab, and find the `exercise9` bundle.

Click the `Build` button. Finally, click `Build it`

## Testing

Now, if you go back to the page you added before, you should now see `test Exercise 9 has been overridden`.
