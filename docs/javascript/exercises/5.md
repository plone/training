# Exercise 5: Simple Pattern

```{warning}
This exercise requires a working buildout using a fork of the `collective.jstraining` package.
```

In this exercise we will be walking through creating a simple Plone pattern.

You will be working in the `exercise5` directory of the `collective.jstraining` package.

## Add Your Pattern File

First off, in your `exercise5/static` directory, add a file named `pattern.js`.
Use this file to build your pattern.

Use [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) to modify the content of an element:

```javascript
define([
  'jquery',
  'pat-base',
], function($, Base) {
  'use strict';

  var Pattern = Base.extend({
    name: 'exercise5',
    trigger: '.pat-exercise5',
    parser: 'mockup',
    defaults: {
    },
    init: function() {
      var that = this;
      that.$el.append(' <span>Exercise 5 was here</span>');
    }
  });

  return Pattern;
});
```

For more details on how to write a mockup pattern, check the various resources available:

- [Minimal pattern](https://github.com/collective/mockup-minimalpattern)
- [Mockup docs](http://plone.github.io/mockup/dev/)
- [Patternslib](https://patternslib.com/)

In our example, we are using the RequireJS `define` function to define our pattern as a JavaScript module.

## Integrating With LESS

Add a `pattern.less` file to the `exercise5/static` directory and provide whatever styles you like for your pattern.

```less
.pat-exercise5 {
  color: red;
}
```

## Creating Your Bundle

To register the pattern, we will create a bundle.
Recall the difference between using `require` and `define` from the RequireJS docs.

Our bundle will use the `require` function to include the JavaScript module pattern we created previously.

Create a `bundle.js` file in your `exercise5/static` directory

```javascript
require([
  'exercise5'
], function() {
  'use strict';
});
```

The only thing we are doing in this file is including the `exercise5` module we defined earlier—that's it.

Bundles can do more as well.
They can include initialization code for example.
See Plone 5's default bundle, [plone-base.js](https://github.com/plone/plone.staticresources/blob/1.x/src/plone/staticresources/static/plone-base.js#L43).

```{note}
The foregoing link targets the `1.x` branch in the repository `plone/plone.staticresources` used by Plone 5.
```

Bundles more or less tell the compiler what we care about loading.
They do the dependency resolution and include the modules that were required with them.

## Register Static Resource Directory

Next, let us register the static directory we just placed our script into.
To register it, you need to add {term}`ZCML` registration for the static directory your script is in.

Add this to the `exercise5/configure.zcml` file

```xml
<plone:static
    directory="static"
    type="plone"
    name="exercise5"
    />
```

## Register Your Bundle

Registering your bundle is done by adding Generic Setup xml configuration to the Plone registry.
This is done in the `registry.xml` file in the `profiles/default` directory.

### Resource

Resource is done exactly the same as in Exercise 1

```xml
<records prefix="plone.resources/exercise5"
         interface='Products.CMFPlone.interfaces.IResourceRegistry'>
  <value key="js">++plone++exercise5/pattern.js</value>
</records>
```

### Bundle Resource

The bundle resource is another resource registration like any other.
Remember, the difference here is in the content of the JavaScript file.

One file uses `require`, the other uses `define`.

Addditionally, we include our CSS/LESS dependencies here

```xml
<records prefix="plone.resources/bundle-exercise5"
         interface='Products.CMFPlone.interfaces.IResourceRegistry'>
  <value key="js">++plone++exercise5/bundle.js</value>
  <value key="css">
    <element>++plone++exercise5/pattern.less</element>
  </value>
</records>
```

### Bundle

Finally, let us create our bundle registration

```xml
<records prefix="plone.bundles/exercise5"
         interface='Products.CMFPlone.interfaces.IBundleRegistry'>
  <value key="resources">
    <!-- reference to bundle resource definition -->
    <element>bundle-exercise5</element>
  </value>
  <value key="merge_with">default</value>
  <value key="enabled">True</value>
  <value key="jscompilation">++plone++exercise5/exercise5-compiled.min.js</value>
  <value key="csscompilation">++plone++exercise5/exercise5-compiled.css</value>
  <value key="last_compilation">2016-10-04 00:00:00</value>

  <!-- so we do not include these modules multiple times -->
  <value key="stub_js_modules">
    <element>jquery</element>
    <element>pat-base</element>
  </value>
</records>
```

## Installation

1. Start up your Plone instance
2. Install the `Exercise 5` add-on

## Running

At this point, we have no compiled version of the code that we are running with so our code does nothing.

1. Go into :{menuselection}`Site Setup --> Resource Registries`
2. Check {guilabel}`Development Mode`
3. Select to develop JavaScript and CSS for the `exercise5` bundle
4. Click {guilabel}`Save`

This should load your JavaScript and LESS files now.
However, we do not have any elements with the `pat-exercise5` class assigned to them.

It is up to you how to apply the pattern class to an element of your choice.
A couple options available to you are:

1. use TinyMCE source view and add `class="pat-exercise5"` onto any `p` tag
2. customize the theme on your site and add it to an element in your theme file or use a diazo rule to dynamically add the class to an element.

## Production

To build our bundle, we will utilize the `plone-compile-resources` script that ships with Plone.

```{warning}
If you are not running a ZEO setup, you will need to shut down your Plone instance since the ZODB in this mode does not allow multiple processes to access it at the same time.
```

An example command will look like this

```shell
./bin/plone-compile-resources --site-id=Plone --bundle=exercise5
```

Once this command finishes, your bundle is built and will be deployed with your package.
