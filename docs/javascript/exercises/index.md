# Exercises

**Prerequisites**

- Fork <https://github.com/collective/collective.jstraining> and clone it with git, and install Plone by executing the following commands:

```shell
git clone <location of your fork>
cd collective.jstraining
./bootstrap.sh
```

`<location of your fork>` should be replaced with where your fork is.

- npm/NodeJS install on your system
- webpack installed on your system
- grunt-cli installed on your system(`npm install -g grunt-cli`)

```{note}
On macOS versions of npm/NodeJS newer than 6.9.1 can make the bundling process fail.
Installing and using version 6.9.1 fixes the problem.
Different versions of NodeJS can be managed with nvm (Node Version Manager).
