# What Is Angular

[Angular](https://angular.io/) is a JavaScript framework released in 2016.

- It is component-oriented.
- It is shipped with RxJS, the Reactive Programming library.
- It works with TypeScript, a superset of EcmaScript 6, which allows a cleaner coding.
- It provides a powerful CLI to build projects.

For these reasons it is a very good framework which is both powerful and easy to use.

```{note}
Angular was initially known as Angular 2 as AngularJS was its ancestor.
Angular and AngularJS are very different.

Their names are quite close, when looking for packages,
verify carefully which Angular it is compliant with.
```
