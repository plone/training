# gatsby-starter-plone

`gatsby-starter-plone` comes with `gatsby-source-plone` already configured and setup with all the functionality and also includes some additional helpful features.

This makes sure you do not spend too much time on the configuration and can focus directly on building your site.

Let us try out the [gatsby-source-plone](https://github.com/collective/gatsby-source-plone/) plugin with our [gatsby-starter-plone](https://github.com/collective/gatsby-starter-plone/) to instantly kickstart GatsbyJS development with Plone.

With the GatsbyJS CLI installed, start up with:

```shell
gatsby new gatsby-plone-training https://github.com/collective/gatsby-starter-plone
```

This will setup a GatsbyJS project in the `gatsby-plone-training` folder with `gatsby-source-plone` setup already, along with a couple of useful extra features.

To see the starter along with the plugin in action, run the following commands and navigate to <http://localhost:8000>.

```shell
cd gatsby-plone-training
gatsby develop
```

Yes! We have a GatsbyJS site sourced from a Plone site up and running.

Take time exploring the static site generated by GatsbyJS and compare it to the Plone site at <https://demo.plone.org/>.

Notice that we have tried to keep them as similar as possible.
