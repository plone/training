# What Is GatsbyJS

[GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) is a modern static site generator for React.

It uses a stack of cutting-edge technologies:

- Babel
- ReactJS
- Webpack
- GraphQL

Combining these technologies together, GatsbyJS allows developers to develop their websites with modern best practices and tools:

- Code splitting, responsive images, etc
- Componentization
- Hot reloading
- One-directional data flow
- ES6 + ES7 automatically transpiled
- PWA

GatsbyJS sets up a project using the latest technologies, pulling data from almost any source, and generating a static site.
It can be done either by whipping together a couple of GatsbyJS plugins, or by using a starter project with all its default configuration.

That is how it is developer friendly.
It has a lot of benefits practically, too.
Static sites mean you do not need to worry about complex server setup, maintenance, and scaling.
Instead you can put GatsbyJS components into a CDN, making the site available as quickly as possible to the users, wherever they are.
