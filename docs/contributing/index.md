## Granting permission to publish

Before you contribute, you must give permission to publish your contribution according to the license we use.
You may give that permission in two ways.

- Sign the [Plone Contributor Agreement](https://plone.org/foundation/contributors-agreement).
  This method also covers contributions to Plone code.
  It is a one-time only process.
- In every pull request or commit message, include the following statement.

  > I, [full name], agree to have this contribution published under Creative Commons 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0), with attribution to the Plone Foundation.

The Plone Trainings Documentation is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
A copy of the license is included in the root of this repository.

## Managing contributions on GitHub

Contributions are managed through the [Training repository on GitHub](https://github.com/plone/training).

First discuss whether you should perform any work.
Any method below is acceptable, but are listed in order of most likely to get a response.

- [Search for open issues](https://github.com/plone/training/issues) and comment on them.
- [Create a new issue](https://github.com/plone/training/issues/new/choose).
- Discuss during conferences, trainings, and other Plone events.
- Ask on the [Plone Community Forum, Training topic](https://community.plone.org/c/training/46).
- Ask in the [Plone chat on Discord](https://discord.com/invite/zFY3EBbjaj).

As a convenience, at the top right of every page, there is a GitHub navigation menu.
Tap, click, or hover over the GitHub Octocat icon for options.

```{tip}
_misused for suggestion_
**Please** add a fourth option in the following menu and description:

```

You can use this menu to quickly navigate to the source repository, open an issue, or suggest an edit to the current document.
Of course, you can use whichever tools you like.

Filing an issue is a valuable contribution to the trainings.
If you want to propose a solution, and you have already put the topic up for discussion and clarified that the topic needs a solution, then please follow the next steps to propose your solution via a pull request.

- Build the trainings as described in {doc}`setup-build`.
- Create a branch.
- Make your changes.
- Run `make test`. 
- If tests are OK: commit your changes. 
- If tests are not OK and you are not sure if it depends on your changes, please contact the community by opening an issue.
- Submit a pull request.
  Optionally, if you want to mark your pull request as a "work in progress" that is not ready to merge or should be discussed further, you can convert it to a draft.

Members who subscribe to the repository will receive a notification and review your request. 

```{note}
Reviewers do not have to build the training on a local machine.
A preview of all pull requests is attempted to be built, and if successful, is available and linked in the pull request comments.
```
