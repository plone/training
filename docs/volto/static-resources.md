# Static Resources

## The Public Folder

The `public` folder contains all the static resources.
These resources will be made available on the root of your project.
By default this contains the `favicon.ico` and the `robots.txt` files.
You can change these files here.

## Exercise

Locate the static resources folder and replace the favicon with a favicon of your choice.
