# Bootstrapping a full Plone 6 project

We will use the official [cookiecutter-plone-starter](https://github.com/collective/cookiecutter-plone-starter) repository.

```{note}
The introduction of more tools are in store in order to ease the creation of the boilerplate for a full Plone 6 project, but they might revolve around this cookiecutter template.
```

## Requirements

### Cookiecutter

Install `cookiecutter` command line in your system or in a virtualenv:

```shell
pip install cookiecutter
```

### nvm, Node.JS, Yeoman, and Yarn

First install `nvm` and latest Node.JS according to the [Plone documentation](https://6.docs.plone.org/install/create-project.html#nvm).

After that, install Yeoman according to the [Plone documentation](https://6.docs.plone.org/install/create-project.html#yeoman-and-the-volto-boilerplate-generator).

Finally, install `yarn` according to the [Plone documentation](https://6.docs.plone.org/install/create-project.html#yarn).

### Docker (optional, but recommended)

Install `Docker` according to the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/).

Generate a new Plone 6 Project:

```shell
cookiecutter gh:collective/cookiecutter-plone-starter
```

`Cookiecutter` generates a file structure.

For an initial build of backend and frontend:

```shell
make install
```

In two separate terminal sessions, start backend and frontend:

To start backend:

```shell
make backend-start
```

To start frontend:

```shell
make frontend-start
```

You can stop each one with {kbd}`ctrl-c`.

After changes please re-build both with

```shell
make build
```

and restart backend and frontend by stopping and re-running

```shell
make backend-start
```

```shell
make frontend-start
```

## Project Generation Options

These are all the template options that will be prompted by the [Cookiecutter CLI](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) prior to generating your project.
