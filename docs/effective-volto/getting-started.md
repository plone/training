# Getting Started

Plone 6, with its suite of backend and frontend, can be quite complex to setup to be able to start developing for it. A developer may come from a "classic Python backend developer" background, with limited modern frontend development experience, or from the other endpoint, as a React frontend developer, without any Plone experience.

Either of these developers will benefit from having a full stack setup, that can run Plone backend from packages or Docker container, and the frontend running natively under nodejs on the developer machine.

So, we will be bootstrapping a Full Plone 6 project in order to follow the training and be able to test the topics introduced.
