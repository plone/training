# This guide offers a step-by-step approach to effectively create, manage, and reorder blocks within a Volto page.

1. In this example, we're editing a page.

By default it will already include the title and first text block.

To add more text, simply press enter. Or click on the "+" to add another block.



````{card}
```{image} _static/creating,-managing,-and-reordering-blocks-01.jpeg
:alt: Click on the "+" to add another block
:target: _static/creating,-managing,-and-reordering-blocks-01.jpeg
```
+++
_Click on the "+" to add another block_
````

2. Click on the type of block you want to add. For this example we'll add a few images and some text.



````{card}
```{image} _static/creating,-managing,-and-reordering-blocks-02.jpeg
:alt: Add type of block you want
:target: _static/creating,-managing,-and-reordering-blocks-02.jpeg
```
+++
_Add type of block you want_
````

3. You can manage a block either in the block itself. The image block allow you to navigate to find or to upload an image.

Most blocks will also have options in the sidebar under the "Block" tab.



````{card}
```{image} _static/creating,-managing,-and-reordering-blocks-03.jpeg
:alt: Manage block options in block
:target: _static/creating,-managing,-and-reordering-blocks-03.jpeg
```
+++
_Manage block options in block_
````

4. For the image block, the sidebar will allow you to navigate to find an image in the site.



````{card}
```{image} _static/creating,-managing,-and-reordering-blocks-04.jpeg
:alt: Manage block options in sidebar
:target: _static/creating,-managing,-and-reordering-blocks-04.jpeg
```
+++
_Manage block options in sidebar_

5. To add another block, again press the "+" button.

```
+++

6. For this example we'll add a grid block to add a few images.



````{card}
```{image} _static/creating,-managing,-and-reordering-blocks-06.jpeg
:alt: Add a grid block
:target: _static/creating,-managing,-and-reordering-blocks-06.jpeg

7. Select the amount of columns.



````{card}
```{image} _static/creating,-managing,-and-reordering-blocks-07.jpeg
:alt: Select the amount of columns
:target: _static/creating,-managing,-and-reordering-blocks-07.jpeg
```
+++
_Select the amount of columns_
````

8. Select the type of block to add to each column.



````{card}
```{image} _static/creating,-managing,-and-reordering-blocks-08.jpeg
:alt: Select the type of block
:target: _static/creating,-managing,-and-reordering-blocks-08.jpeg
```
+++
_Select the type of block_
````

9. We'll add an image in each column.



````{card}

:alt: Add an image in each column
:target: _static/creating,-managing,-and-reordering-blocks-09.jpeg
```
+++
_Add an image in each column_

10. After finishing the columns, again press the "+" button.



````{card}
```{image} _static/creating,-managing,-and-reordering-blocks-10.jpeg
:alt: To add another block, press the "+" button
:target: _static/creating,-managing,-and-reordering-blocks-10.jpeg
```
+++

````

11. We'll now add some text.



````{card}
```{image} _static/creating,-managing,-and-reordering-blocks-11.jpeg
:alt: Add some text
:target: _static/creating,-managing,-and-reordering-blocks-11.jpeg
```
+++
_Add some text_
````

12. Click inside the text block and paste or type.



````{card}
```{image} _static/creating,-managing,-and-reordering-blocks-12.jpeg
:alt: Click inside the text block and paste or type
:target: _static/creating,-managing,-and-reordering-blocks-12.jpeg
```
+++
_Click inside the text block and paste or type_

13. After adding text, we will now reorder the blocks.
