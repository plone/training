# Add an Image Block to a Page

You can add an image to a page by adding an image block.

This is different from adding an image content item, which is an item on its own.

When you add an image block to a page, you can place the image block on the page anywhere you want, including wrapping text around it or placing the image block to the left or right of text.

Here we add a new page then add an image block to it.

1. Click the {guilabel}`add item` button.

   ````{card}
   ```{image} _static/add-an-image-block-to-a-page-01.jpeg
   :alt: The add item button
   :target: _static/add-an-image-block-to-a-page-01.jpeg
   ```
   +++
   _The add item button_
   ````

2. Click {guilabel}`Page`

   ````{card}
   ```{image} _static/add-an-image-block-to-a-page-02.jpeg
   :alt: Add a Page
   :target: _static/add-an-image-block-to-a-page-02.jpeg
   ```
   +++
   _Add a Page_
   ````

3. Type the title of this new page. For example, "Sample Page {kbd}`Enter`"

    Once you press {kbd}`Enter`, a new text block is added below and the cursor moves to it.
    
    Type the slash character ({kbd}`/`) to change this block to a different type.


4. In the menu that appears, click {kbd}`Image`.

   ````{card}
   ```{image} _static/add-an-image-block-to-a-page-03.jpeg
   :alt: Add an Image block
   :target: _static/add-an-image-block-to-a-page-03.jpeg
   ```
   +++
   _Add an Image block_
   ````

5. The text block changes to an image block.

    To specify the image, you can choose one of the following methods:

   - Select an image that already exists in the site
   - Upload an image from your computer
   - Provide the web address of an image that is available on the Internet

    For this example, we want to select an existing image from this site.

   ````{card}
   ```{image} _static/add-an-image-block-to-a-page-04.jpeg
   :alt: The navigate button
   :target: _static/add-an-image-block-to-a-page-04.jpeg
   ```
   +++
   _The navigate button_
   ````

6. In the image search panel that appears on the right, you can navigate throughout the site or you can type a search string to find the image you want. 

    For this example, we click an image we had added to the site earlier.

   ````{card}
   ```{image} _static/add-an-image-block-to-a-page-05.jpeg
   :alt: Choose an image
   :target: _static/add-an-image-block-to-a-page-05.jpeg
   ```
   +++
   _Choose an image_
   ````

7. In the right panel, click the {kbd}`Alt text` field to provide a description of the image.

    This description will be presented to screen readers and will help visually impaired visitors to understand what the image represents.

   ````{card}
   ```{image} _static/add-an-image-block-to-a-page-06.jpeg
   :alt: Set the image alt text
   :target: _static/add-an-image-block-to-a-page-06.jpeg
   ```
   +++
   _Set the image alt text_
   ````

8. The Title field is set to the same one that is on the image we chose. You can change the title here if you wish.
