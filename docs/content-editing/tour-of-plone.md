# A Tour of Plone

Let's take a look at what you see on a typical Plone page.

1. Navigate to [https://demo.plone.org/](https://demo.plone.org/)


2. The header contains several things, starting with these "tools" for:

   - logging in
   - viewing the site map
   - contacting the site owners

   ````{card}
   ```{image} _static/tour-of-plone-01.jpeg
   :alt: Site tools
   :target: _static/tour-of-plone-01.jpeg
   ```
   +++
   _Site tools_
   ````

3. The header also contains the site logo. 

    Clicking on it from anywhere in the site will take you to the home page.

   ````{card}
   ```{image} _static/tour-of-plone-02.jpeg
   :alt: The site logo
   :target: _static/tour-of-plone-02.jpeg
   ```
   +++
   _The site logo_
   ````

4. The header also contains these navigation links. 

    These navigation links are usually to top level pages (pages at the top, or root, of the site), but can also link to other items elsewhere on the site.

   ````{card}
   ```{image} _static/tour-of-plone-03.jpeg
   :alt: Navigation links
   :target: _static/tour-of-plone-03.jpeg
   ```
   +++

   ````

5. The header also includes the search tool. 

    Clicking on the {guilabel}`Search` button lets you search the site.

   ```

   ````

6. Below the header area is the content area of the page.

    A page is composed of blocks that can be, among others, images, videos, sliders, and layout controls such as grids.

   ````{card}
   ```{image} _static/tour-of-plone-05.jpeg
   :alt: A slider block
   :target: _static/tour-of-plone-05.jpeg
   ```
   +++
   _A slider block_
   ````

7. This slider, for example, lets visitors view multiple featured items, each linking to pages elsewhere on the site. 

    Clicking on the slider controls lets visitors change which featured item to view.

   ````{card}
   ```{image} _static/tour-of-plone-06.jpeg
   :alt: Slider controls
   :target: _static/tour-of-plone-06.jpeg

8. Click here on the slider control to view the next feature.

   :target: _static/tour-of-plone-07.jpeg
   ```
   +++
   _Click to change the slide shown_

9. Below the slider are some examples of blocks.

   ````{card}
   ```{image} _static/tour-of-plone-08.jpeg
   :alt: A grid block
   :target: _static/tour-of-plone-08.jpeg
   ```
   +++
   _A grid block_
   ````

10. The footer contains an optional message, as well as links to the same site map and contact form as appeared in the header.

    Clicking on the footer logo takes you to the home page of this site.

   ````{card}
   ```{image} _static/tour-of-plone-09.jpeg
