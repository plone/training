# Project requirements

Our hands-on exercise is to (re)build `plone.org` using Volto.
This is what `plone.org` looks like:

```{image} _static/plone.com_index.png
:align: center
:alt: plone.com theme
```

## Tasks

These are the tasks we will go through:

- Set up CSS basics
- Create the header and the footer
- Create a main slider
- Develop a view for the Success Story content type
- Create a three-column highlights center element

We'll leave these tasks for later:

- creating a five element row
- showing the list of sponsors
- developing the "prefooter"
- showing a list of Success Story content items
