# Mastering Plone 6 development

*Mastering Plone Development* is intended as a training to learn proven practices of Plone development.
It's both, an online course and a sketch for an on-the-spot training.

The story of a conference platform provides a training of several development topics that can be split in two trainings:

- A beginner training (2 to 3 days) covering the essentials of Plone development.
- An advanced training (3 to 5 days) with additional advanced topics concerning the Plone backend.

```{note}
*Mastering Plone 6 Development Training* focuses on Plone backend architecture and topics of Volto development as long as the backend is involved.

We do not deal with pure Volto topics here.
For Volto development see training {doc}`/effective-volto/index`.

We expect you to work with the Plone React frontend (former called Volto).
Therefore we do not deal with Plone Classic topics here.
For Plone Classic see training {doc}`/theming/index`, training {doc}`/mastering-plone-5/index` and documentation {doc}`plone6docs:classic-ui/index`
```

Please note that this document is *not complete* without the spoken word of a trainer.

We attempt to include the most important parts of what we teach in the training. But reading it here can not be considered equal to attending a training.
