# Trainer: Preparation

Preparation of a Mastering Plone Development Training

You are about to give a training. Here are some tips what to prepare before.


## Technical set up to do before a training

- Prepare a mail server for the user registration mail (See {ref}`features-mailserver-label`)
- Update the Plone version in [training_buildout](https://github.com/collective/training_buildout/blob/main/constraints.txt) of collective/training_buildout.
- Update the Volto version in [volto-ploneconf](https://github.com/collective/volto-ploneconf/blob/main/mrs.developer.json).
- If you do only a part of the training, prepare an installation with the steps of the previous chapters.
See {doc}`/mastering-plone/code` for more information.
