# About Mastering Plone development

The *Mastering Plone Development* training is both: an online training and a handout for on-site trainings.  
We address developers.
You are interested in best practice guides and want to learn the why and where, so read on!

## The beginning and the continuation

This training was initially started as a Plone Classic training and evolved now to a roundtrip on both: Plone backend, React frontend and the interplay between backend and frontend.

This training is published on [training.plone.org](https://training.plone.org/).

We update the training ongoing to teach the best practices.
You are welcome to contribute and give feedback on [GitHub issues](https://github.com/plone/training/issues).

Thank you for reading and your charity with non-native English speakers / writers.
