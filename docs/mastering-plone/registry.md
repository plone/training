## Introduction

Do you remember the fields `audience` and `type_of_talk` in the talk content type?
We provided several options to choose from that were hard-coded in the schema.

Next we want to add a field to assign talks to a room.
Since the conference next year will have different room names, these values need to be editable.

And while we're at it: It would be much better to have the options for `audience` and `type_of_talk` editable by admins as well, e.g. to be able to add _Lightning Talks_!

By combining the registry, a control panel and vocabularies you can allow rooms to be editable options.

To be able to do so you first need to get to know the registry.

## The Registry

The registry is used to get and set values stored in records.
Each record consists of the actual value, as well as a field that describes the record in more detail.
It has a nice dict-like API.

Since Plone 5 all global settings are stored in the registry.

The registry itself is provided by [plone.registry](https://pypi.org/project/plone.registry) and the UI to interact with it by [plone.app.registry](https://pypi.org/project/plone.app.registry)

Almost all settings in `/plone_control_panel` are actually stored in the registry and can be modified using its UI directly.

Open http://localhost:8080/Plone/portal_registry and filter for `displayed_types`.
You see that you can modify the content types that should be shown in the navigation and site map.
The values are the same as in http://localhost:8080/Plone/@@navigation-controlpanel, but the latter form is customized for usability.

```{note}
This UI for the registry is not yet available in the frontend.
```

## Registry Records

In {doc}`volto_frontpage` you already added a criterion usable for listing blocks in {file}`profiles/default/registry/querystring.xml`.
This setting is stored in the registry.

Let's look at existing values in the registry.

Go to http://localhost:3000/controlpanel/navigation and add `talk` to the field {guilabel}`Displayed content types`.
Talks in the root will now show up in the navigation.
This setting is stored in the registry record `plone.displayed_types`.

## Accessing and modifying records in the registry

In Python you can access the registry record with the key `plone.displayed_types` via {py:mod}`plone.api`.
It holds convenience methods to `get` and `set` a record:

```{code-block} python

from plone import api

api.portal.get_registry_record('plone.displayed_types')
api.portal.set_registry_record('plone.smtp_host', 'my.mail.server')
```

The access of the registry by `zope.component.getUtility` is often seen in code from before the time of `plone.api`.

```{code-block} python

from plone.registry.interfaces import IRegistry
from zope.component import getUtility

registry = getUtility(IRegistry)
displayed_types = registry.get('plone.displayed_types')
```

The value of the record `displayed_types` is the tuple `('Image', 'File', 'Link', 'News Item', 'Folder', 'Document', 'Event', 'talk')`

## Custom registry records

Now let's add our own custom settings:

- Is talk submission open or closed?
- Which rooms are available for talks?

While we're at it we can also add new settings `types_of_talk` and `audiences` that we will use later for the fields `type_of_talk` and `audience`.

To define custom records, you write the same type of schema as you already did for content types or for behaviors:

Add a file {file}`controlpanel/controlpanel.py`:

```{code-block} python
:linenos:

from plone import schema
from plone.autoform import directives
from zope.interface import Interface

VOCABULARY_SCHEMA = json.dumps(

            ]
        },
        missing_value={"items": []},
    )
    directives.widget(

        },
    )

    rooms = schema.JSONField(
        title="Rooms",
        description="Available rooms of the conference",
        required=False,
        schema=VOCABULARY_SCHEMA,
        default={
            "items": [

                    },
                },
                {
                    "token": "auditorium",
                    "titles": {
                        "en": "Auditorium",
                        "de": "Auditorium",
                    },
                },
            ]
        },
        missing_value={"items": []},
    )
    directives.widget(
        "rooms",
        frontendOptions={
            "widget": "vocabularyterms",
        },
    )

```

The motivation to use `schema.JSONField` instead of `schema.List` is described as follows.

The options for the types of a talk, the room and the audience may change.
A modification of the feeding vocabulary would mean that already used options are no longer available, which would corrupt the data of the concerned talks.
We can "future-proof" this vocabulary with JSONFields that store a vocabulary source in the registry.
This vocabulary is a list of dictionaries, with keys that never change, and values that may be modified when necessary.
See the default values to understand what is stored in the registry:
Example `types_of_talk`:

```{code-block} python
[
    {
        "token": "talk",
        "titles": {
            "en": "Talk",
            "de": "Vortrag",
        },
    },
    {
        "token": "lightning-talk",
        "titles": {
            "en": "Lightning-Talk",
            "de": "Lightning-Talk",
        },
    },
]
```

If the name "Lightning-Talk" needs to be changed to "Short talks", the talks marked as lightning talks do show up correct, as the value saved on the talks is the token "lightning-talk" which does not change ever.

We introduced a new field `JSONField`.
As the name says, it describes a field that will be populated with JSON data.
The field is fitted with a schema describing the valid form of the field values.

```python
    directives.widget(
        "audiences",
        frontendOptions={
            "widget": "vocabularyterms",
        },
    )
```

The `frontendOptions` forces Volto to display on editing the field with a widget prepared for vocabulary terms.
More correct, it forces Volto to lookup the widget in `Volto's` widget mapping to find the corresponding widget.


We now register this schema `IPloneconfSettings` for the registry.
Add the following to {file}`profiles/default/registry/main.xml`.
With this statement the registry is extended by one record per `IPloneconfSettings` schema field.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<registry
    xmlns:i18n="http://xml.zope.org/namespaces/i18n"
    i18n:domain="ploneconf.site">

  <records
      interface="ploneconf.site.controlpanel.controlpanel.IPloneconfSettings"
      prefix="ploneconf" />

</registry>
```

```{note}
The `prefix` allows you to access these records with a shortcut:
You can use `ploneconf.rooms` instead of `ploneconf.site.controlpanel.controlpanel.IPloneconfSettings.rooms`.
```

After reinstalling the package to apply the registry changes, you can access and modify these registry records as described above.
Either use http://localhost:8080/Plone/portal_registry or `Python`:

```python
from plone import api

api.portal.get_registry_record('ploneconf.rooms')
```

`````{note}
In training code `ploneconf.site`, we use `Python` to define the registry records.
Alternatively you could add these registry entries with Generic Setup.

The following creates a new entry `ploneconf.talk_submission_open` with Generic Setup:

```{code-block} xml
:linenos:

<record name="ploneconf.talk_submission_open">
  <field type="plone.registry.field.Bool">
    <title>Allow talk submission</title>
    <description>Allow the submission of talks for anonymous users</description>
    <required>False</required>
  </field>
  <value>False</value>
</record>
```

When creating a new vanilla Plone instance, a lot of default settings are created that way.
See https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/blob/master/Products/CMFPlone/profiles/dependencies/registry.xml to see how {py:mod}`Products.CMFPlone` registers values.
`````


(controlpanel-label)=

## Add a custom control panel

Now you will add a custom control panel to edit all settings related to our package with a nice UI.

To register a control panel for the frontend and Plone Classic you need quite a bit of boiler-plate:

```{code-block} python
:emphasize-lines: 1-2, 16-25
:linenos:

from plone.restapi.controlpanels import RegistryConfigletPanel
from zope.component import adapter

# ‚Ä¶

class IPloneconfSettings(Interface):
    talk_submission_open = schema.Bool(
        title="Allow talk submission",
        description="Allow the submission of talks for anonymous user",
        default=False,
        required=False,
    )

# ‚Ä¶

@adapter(Interface, Interface)
class PloneConfRegistryConfigletPanel(RegistryConfigletPanel):
    """Volto control panel"""

    schema = IPloneconfSettings
    schema_prefix = "ploneconf"
    configlet_id = "ploneconf-controlpanel"
    configlet_category_id = "Products"
    title = "Ploneconf Settings"
    group = "Products"
```

You also need to register the adapter in {file}`controlpanel/configure.zcml`:

```{code-block} xml
:linenos:

  <adapter
    factory="ploneconf.site.controlpanel.controlpanel.PloneConfRegistryConfigletPanel"
    name="ploneconf-controlpanel" />
```

Finally register the configlet with Generic Setup so that it gets listed in the {guilabel}`Site Setups` panels list (often called 'control panel').
Add a file {file}`profiles/default/controlpanel.xml`:

```{code-block} xml
:linenos:
:emphasize-lines: 9

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<object name="portal_controlpanel">
  <configlet action_id="ploneconf-controlpanel"
             appId="ploneconf-controlpanel"
             category="Products"
             title="Ploneconf Settings"
             visible="True"
  >
    <permission>Manage portal</permission>
  </configlet>
</object>

```

After applying the profile (for example, by reinstalling the package), your control panel shows up on <http://localhost:3000/controlpanel/ploneconf-controlpanel>

```{figure} _static/volto_ploneconf_controlpanel_overview.png
```


```{figure} _static/volto_ploneconf_controlpanel.png
```

As you can see in the control panel configlet for the `ploneconf.site` package, the entries can be modified and reordered. Changes are reflected in the registry as the configlet is registered as a wrapped edit form of the `IPloneconfSettings` schema.

````{note}
**Frontend widgets**

A short remark on the frontend widget.
We want the `VocabularyTermsWidget` to be applied.
Thus we specify a hint, using a so-called "tagged value", the name of the frontend widget to be applied for the three control panel fields in our backend schema.
Thus no widget registration in the frontend app is needed.

```python
directives.widget(
    "types_of_talk",
    frontendOptions={
        "widget": "vocabularyterms",
    },
)
```
This is also the way you would configure a content type schema, where you may want to override the default widget.

A widget component in your frontend package would be mapped to a key "mywidget".
In your content type schema you would add a widget directive with
`frontendOptions={"widget": "mywidget"}`
````

(vocabularies-label)=

## Vocabularies

Now the custom settings are stored in the registry and we can modify them in a nice way as site administrators.
We still need to use these options in talks.

To do so we turn them into vocabularies.

Vocabularies are often used for selection fields.
They have many benefits:

- They allow you to separate the select option values from the content type schema.
  This means that they can be edited via the UI.
- A vocabulary can even be set dynamically.
  The available options can change depending on existing content, the role of the user, or even the time of day.

Create a file {file}`vocabularies/talk.py` and write code that generates vocabularies from these settings:

```{code-block} python
:linenos:
:emphasize-lines: 13-15

from plone import api
from zope.interface import provider
from zope.schema.interfaces import IVocabularyFactory
from zope.schema.vocabulary import SimpleVocabulary


@provider(IVocabularyFactory)
def TalkTypesVocabulary(context):
    name = "ploneconf.types_of_talk"
    registry_record_value = api.portal.get_registry_record(name)
    items = registry_record_value.get("items", [])
    lang = api.portal.get_current_language()
    return SimpleVocabulary.fromItems(
        [[item["token"], item["token"], item["titles"][lang]] for item in items]
    )


@provider(IVocabularyFactory)
def AudiencesVocabulary(context):
    name = "ploneconf.audiences"
    registry_record_value = api.portal.get_registry_record(name)
    items = registry_record_value.get("items", [])
    lang = api.portal.get_current_language()
    return SimpleVocabulary.fromItems(
        [[item["token"], item["token"], item["titles"][lang]] for item in items]
    )


@provider(IVocabularyFactory)
def RoomsVocabularyFactory(context):
    name = "ploneconf.rooms"
    registry_record_value = api.portal.get_registry_record(name)
    items = registry_record_value.get("items", [])
    lang = api.portal.get_current_language()
    return SimpleVocabulary.fromItems(
        [[item["token"], item["token"], item["titles"][lang]] for item in items]
    )
```

The `SimpleVocabulary.fromItems()` is a method that takes the list of dictionaries of vocabulary terms

```python
[
    {
        "token": "talk",
        "titles": {
            "en": "Talk",
            "de": "Vortrag",
        },
    },
    {
        "token": "lightning-talk",
        "titles": {
            "en": "Lightning-Talk",
            "de": "Lightning-Talk",
        },
    },
]
```

and creates a Zope vocabulary.
This `SimpleVocabulary` instance has methods that Plone uses to display select widgets, display the rendered content type instance according the user language, etc..

You can now register these vocabularies as named utilities in {file}`vocabularies/configure.zcml`:

```xml

<utility
    name="ploneconf.types_of_talk"
    component="ploneconf.site.vocabularies.talk.TalkTypesVocabulary" />
<utility
    name="ploneconf.audiences"
    component="ploneconf.site.vocabularies.talk.AudiencesVocabulary" />
<utility
    name="ploneconf.rooms"
    component="ploneconf.site.vocabularies.talk.RoomsVocabularyFactory" />
```

From now on you can use these vocabulary by referring to their name, e.g. `ploneconf.rooms`.

```{note}
- Plone comes with many useful named vocabularies that you can use in your own projects, for example `plone.app.vocabularies.Users` or `plone.app.vocabularies.PortalTypes`.

- See <https://github.com/plone/plone.app.vocabularies/> for a list of vocabularies.

- We turn the values from the registry into a dynamic `SimpleVocabulary` that can be used in the schema.

- You could use the context with which the vocabulary is called or the request (using `getRequest` from `zope.globalrequest`) to constrain the values in the vocabulary.
```

```{seealso}
Plone documentation [Vocabularies](https://5.docs.plone.org/external/plone.app.dexterity/docs/advanced/vocabularies.html).
```

## Using vocabularies in a schema

To use a vocabulary in a schema field, replace the attribute `values` with `vocabulary`, and point to a vocabulary by its name:

```{code-block} python
:emphasize-lines: 3
:linenos:

type_of_talk = schema.Choice(
    title='Type of talk',
    vocabulary='ploneconf.types_of_talk',
    required=True,
)
```

Don't forget to add the new field `room`.

Edit {file}`content/talk.py`:

```{code-block} python
:emphasize-lines: 19, 33, 81-85
:linenos:

from plone.app.textfield import RichText
from plone.autoform import directives
from plone.dexterity.content import Container
from plone.namedfile.field import NamedBlobImage

from plone.supermodel import model
from z3c.form.browser.checkbox import CheckBoxFieldWidget
from z3c.form.browser.radio import RadioFieldWidget
from zope import schema
from zope.interface import implementer


class ITalk(model.Schema):
    """Dexterity-Schema for Talks"""

    directives.widget(type_of_talk=RadioFieldWidget)
    type_of_talk = schema.Choice(
        title="Type of talk",
        vocabulary="ploneconf.types_of_talk",
        required=True,
    )

    details = RichText(
        title="Details",
        description="Description of the talk (max. 2000 characters)",
        max_length=2000,
        required=True,
    )

    directives.widget(audience=CheckBoxFieldWidget)
    audience = schema.Set(
        title="Audience",
        value_type=schema.Choice(
            vocabulary="ploneconf.audiences",
        ),
        required=False,
    )

    speaker = schema.TextLine(
        title="Speaker",
        description="Name (or names) of the speaker",
        required=False,

## Adjust frontend according schema changes

With the new key value pairs (token/title) we adjust the component accordingly:

```jsx
      {content.audience?.map((item) => {
        let color = color_mapping[item.token] || 'green';
        return (
          <Label key={item.token} color={color}>
            {item.title}
          </Label>
        );
      })}
```

One tiny thing is still missing: We should display the room.

Modify {file}`frontend/src/components/Views/Talk.jsx` an add this after the `When` component:

```{code-block}
:emphasize-lines: 6

    {content.room && (
      <>
        <Header dividing sub>
          Where
        </Header>
        <p>{content.room.title}</p>
      </>
    )}
```

## Summary

- You successfully combined the registry, a control panel and vocabularies to allow managing field options by site administrators.
- It seems like a lot but you will certainly use dynamic vocabularies, control panels and the registry in most of your future Plone projects in one way or another.
