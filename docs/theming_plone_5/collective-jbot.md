# Jbot

```{topic} collective.jbot
Customize templates on the fly with collective.jbot
```

```{note}
Not yet compatible with Plone 5!
```

Back in the old days we used to customize views' templates from the tool `portal_view_customizations` from the ZMI.

This tool has no UI (User Interface) and could beat you whenever you don't expect it.

[Nathan Van Gheem](https://twitter.com/vangheezy) has created this package that unfortunately is not (yet!) part of the core: [collective.jbot](https://github.com/collective/collective.jbot).

This package uses the well-known `z3c.jbot` under the hood and allows you to customize templates TTW (Through-The-Web) from the control panel.

## Installation

## Usage
