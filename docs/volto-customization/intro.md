Before we dive into the content of this training, I'd like to make a helpful suggestion. If you're new to Volto and React or feel like you could benefit from a refresher, it might be a great idea to [explore some existing Volto and React training resources](https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/playlist?list=PLGN9BI-OAQkTVkkJfSMHu-l-_AVW_uoRf&privacy_mode=1) that can provide you with a solid foundation. These resources can serve as valuable supplements to what we'll cover here.

We have designed this training to be beginner-friendly, but having some prior exposure to these technologies can be advantageous. It will help you grasp the concepts more quickly and make the learning experience even more enjoyable.

Of course, if you're already familiar with Volto and React, that's fantastic, and you're well-prepared for this training. Regardless of your experience level, we're here to support your learning journey every step of the way.
