# cross-reference that has no matching target in the current documentation set,
# it looks for targets in the documentation sets configured in
# intersphinx_mapping. A reference like :py:class:`zipfile.ZipFile` can then
# linkto the Python documentation for the ZipFile class, without you having to
# specify where it is located exactly.
