# About

This training was created by [Tiberiu Ichim](https://x.com/ichim_tiberiu)
in collaboration with [Víctor Fernández de Alba](https://x.com/sneridagh).

> I have been a web developer since the turn of the millennium, primarily
> as a Zope and Plone developer. That didn't stop me from working on projects
> with Pyramid, VueJS, Tensorflow, Django, Ruby on Rails, Linked Data and XML
> techologies such as XSLT and XQuery. Lately I've set everything aside to
> make room for Volto.
>
> If there's one thing I can say about Volto is that I'm in awe with it and
> the vision of its initial designers and developers. The fact that it
> exists, the craziness of even thinking about starting this project with
> just a dream and limited resources, this is something that has my deepest
> respect. Sure, it may not be perfect and there's plenty to improve, but it
> has all the qualities that made Plone great from the start: it opens
> a world of possibilities that didn't exist before and most important, it's
> useful right now.

> Víctor is CTO at kitconcept GmbH, a Plone solution provider from Bonn, Germany.
> Member of the Plone Community since 2006, author of a Plone book, co-author of
> Plone 5’s multilingual feature and its default theme Barceloneta. He is the
> Volto release manager, member of the Volto Team and Plone REST API contributor.
> He was also organizer of the Barcelona Plone Conference in 2017, sprints and
> other Plone events in Barcelona and Bonn and he is deeply involved in several
> Plone Community Teams including the Plone Foundation Board of directors.

The first editions were recorded as part of the Plone Conference 2020 and are
