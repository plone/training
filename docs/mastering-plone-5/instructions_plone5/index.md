# Installing Plone for the Training

Keep in mind that you need a fast Internet connection during installation since you'll have to download a lot of data!

```{warning}
If you feel the desire to try out both methods below (with Vagrant and without),
make sure you use different {file}`training` directories!

The two installations do not coexist well.
```

(plone5-instructions-no-vagrant-label)=

## Installing Plone without vagrant

```{warning}
If you are new to running Plone on your laptop you could skip this part and continue with {ref}`plone5-install-virtualbox`.
```

If you **are** experienced with running Plone on your own laptop, we encourage you to do so because you will have certain benefits:

- You can use the editor you are used to.
- You can use *omelette* to have all the code of Plone at your fingertips.
- You don't have to switch between different operating systems during the training.

If you feel comfortable, please work on your own machine with your own Python.

**Please** make sure that you have a system that will work, since we don't want you to lose valuable time!

```{note}
If you also want to follow the JavaScript training and install the JavaScript development tools,
you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) installed on your development computer.
```

```{note}
Please make sure you have your system properly prepared and installed all necessary prerequisites.
```

The following instructions are based on Ubuntu and macOS.
If you use a different operating system (OS), please adjust them to fit your OS.

On Ubuntu/Debian, you need to make sure you system is up-to-date:

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y upgrade
```

Then, you need to install the following packages:

```shell
sudo apt-get install python3.9-dev python3.9-tk python3.9-venv build-essential libssl-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libbz2-dev libjpeg62-dev
sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev wv poppler-utils
sudo apt-get install git
```

On macOS you at least need to install some dependencies with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

```shell
brew install zlib git readline jpeg libpng libyaml
```

For more information or in case of problems see the [official installation instructions](https://5.docs.plone.org/manage/installing/installation.html).

Set up Plone for the training like this if you use your own OS (Linux or Mac):

```shell
mkdir training
cd training
git clone https://github.com/collective/training_buildout.git buildout
cd buildout
python3.9 -m venv .
./bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This creates a Python virtual environment with Python 3.9 in the folder {file}`buildout` and installs some requirements in it.

Now you can run the buildout for the first time:

```shell
./bin/buildout
```

This will take **a long time** (~10 minutes on the least powerful Linode) and will produce a lot of output because it downloads and configures more than 260 Python packages.
Once it is done, you can start your Plone instance with the following command.

```shell
./bin/instance fg
```

The output should be similar to:

```{code-block} console
:emphasize-lines: 40

(plone5-instructions-vagrant-label)=

## Installing Plone with Vagrant

We use a virtual machine (Ubuntu 18.04) to run Plone during the training.

We rely on [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) to give the same development environment to everyone.

[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) is a tool for building complete development environments.

We use it together with Oracle’s [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) to create and manage a virtual environment.

(plone5-install-virtualbox)=

### Install VirtualBox

Vagrant uses Oracle’s VirtualBox to create virtual environments.

Here is a link directly to the download page: <https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads>.

We use VirtualBox 6.0.x.

(plone5-instructions-configure-vagrant-label)=

### Install and configure Vagrant

Get the latest version from <https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/install> for your operating system and install it.

Now your system has a command {command}`vagrant` that you can run in the terminal.

First, create a directory in which you want to do the training.

```{warning}
If you already have a {file}`training` directory because you followed the {ref}`plone5-instructions-no-vagrant-label` instructions above,
you should either delete it, rename it, or use a different name below.
```

```shell
mkdir training
cd training
```

Setup Vagrant to automatically install the current guest additions.
You can choose to skip this step if you encounter any problems with it.

```shell
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
```

Now download {download}`plone_training_config.zip <../../_static/plone_training_config.zip>` and copy its contents into your training directory.

```shell
wget https://github.com/plone/training/raw/refs/heads/main/docs/_static/plone_training_config.zip
unzip plone_training_config.zip
```

The training directory should now hold the file {file}`Vagrantfile` and the directory {file}`manifests` which again contains several files.

Now start setting up the virtual machine (VM) that is configured in {file}`Vagrantfile`:

```shell
vagrant up
```

This takes a **veeeeery loooong time** (between 10 minutes and 1 hour depending on your Internet connection and system speed) since it does all the following steps:

- downloads a virtual machine (Official Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS, also called "Bionic Beaver")
- sets up the VM
- updates the VM
- installs various system-packages needed for Plone development
- clones the training buildout into `/vagrant/buildout`
- builds Plone annd installs all dependencies

````{note}
Sometimes this stops with the message:

```shell
Skipping because of failed dependencies
```
````

If this happens or you have the feeling that something has gone wrong and the installation has not finished correctly for some reason
you need to run the following command to repeat the process.

This will only repeat steps that have not finished correctly.

```shell
vagrant provision
```

You can do this multiple times to fix problems, for example, if your network connection was down and steps could not finish because of this.

````{note}
If while bringing vagrant up you get an error similar to:

```shell
ssh_exchange_identification: read: Connection reset by peer
```
````

The configuration may have stalled out because your computer's BIOS requires virtualization to be enabled.
Check with your computer's manufacturer on how to properly enable virtualization.

See: <https://teamtreehouse.com/community/vagrant-ssh-sshexchangeidentification-read-connection-reset-by-peer>

Once Vagrant finishes the provisioning process, you can login to the now running virtual machine.

```shell
vagrant ssh
```

```{note}
If you use Windows you'll have to login with [putty](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html).
Connect to <mailto:vagrant@127.0.01> at port 2222. User **and** password are `vagrant`.
```

You are now logged in as the user vagrant in {file}`/home/vagrant`.

We'll do all steps of the training as this user.

Instead we use our own Plone instance during the training.
It is in {file}`/vagrant/buildout/`. Start it in foreground with {command}`./bin/instance fg`.

```console
vagrant@training:~$ cd /vagrant/buildout/
vagrant@training:/vagrant/buildout$ ./bin/instance fg

```

````{note}
In rare cases when you are using macOS with an UTF-8 character set starting Plone might fail with the following error:

```text
ValueError: unknown locale: UTF-8
```
````

In that case you have to put the localized keyboard and language settings in the {file}`.bash_profile`
of the Vagrant user to your locale (like `en_US.UTF-8` or `de_DE.UTF-8`).

```shell
export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
```

Now the Zope instance we're using is running.
You can stop the running instance anytime using {kbd}`ctrl + c`.

If it doesn't, don't worry, your shell isn't blocked.

Type {kbd}`reset` (even if you can't see the prompt) and press {kbd}`return`, and it should become visible again.

If you point your local browser at <http://localhost:8080> you see that Plone is running in Vagrant.

This works because VirtualBox forwards the port 8080 from the guest system (the Vagrant Ubuntu) to the host system (your normal operating system).

There is no Plone site yet - we will create one in {doc}`/mastering-plone-5/features`.

The Buildout for this Plone is in a shared folder.
This means we run it in the Vagrant box from {file}`/vagrant/buildout` but we can also access it in our own operating system and use our favorite editor.

You will find the directory {file}`buildout` in the directory {file}`training` that you created in the beginning
next to {file}`Vagrantfile` and {file}`manifests`.

```{note}
The database and the Python packages are not accessible in your own system since large files cannot make use of symlinks in shared folders.
The database lies in `/home/vagrant/var`, the Python packages are in `/home/vagrant/packages`.
```

### What Vagrant does

Installation is done automatically by Vagrant and Puppet.
If you want to know which steps are actually done please see the chapter {doc}`what_vagrant_does`.

(plone5-instructions-vagrant-care-handling-label)=

```{note}
**Vagrant Care and Handling**

Keep in mind the following recommendations for using your Vagrant VirtualBoxes:

- Use the {command}`vagrant suspend` or {command}`vagrant halt` commands to put the VirtualBox to "sleep" or to "power it off" before attempting to start another Plone instance anywhere else on your machine, if it uses the same port.  That's because vagrant "reserves" port 8080, and even if you stopped Plone in vagrant, that port is still in use by the guest OS.
- If you are done with a vagrant box, and want to delete it, always remember to run {command}`vagrant destroy` on it before actually deleting the directory containing it.  Otherwise you'll leave its "ghost" in the list of boxes managed by Vagrant and possibly taking up disk space on your machine.
- See {command}`vagrant help` for all available commands, including {command}`suspend`, {command}`halt`, {command}`destroy`, {command}`up`, {command}`ssh` and {command}`resume`.
```
