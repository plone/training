# IDEs and Editors

In this part you will:

- Learn about editors

Topics covered:

- Many editors

Plone consists of more than 20.000 files! You need a tool to manage that. No development environment is complete without a good editor.

People pick editors themselves. Use whatever you are comfortable and productive with. Here are some of the most used editors in the Plone community:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/)
- [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)

Some features that most editors have in one form or another are essential when developing with Plone.

- **Find in project** (SublimeText 3: `cmd + shift + f`)
- **Find files in Project** (SublimeText 3: `cmd + t`)
- **Find methods and classes in Project** (SublimeText 3: `cmd + shift + r`)
- **Goto Definition** (SublimeText3 with codeintel: `alt + click`)
- **Powerful search & replace**

The capability of performing a *full text search* through the complete Plone code is invaluable. Thanks to omelette, an SSD and plenty of RAM you can search through the complete Plone code base in 3 seconds.

```{note}
Some editors and IDEs have to be extended to be fully featured. Here are some packages we recommend when using Sublime Text 3:

- BracketHighlighter
- GitGutter
- FileDiffs
- SublimeLinter with SublimeLinter-flake8 ...
- INI (syntax for ini-Files)
- SideBarEnhancements
- SyncedSideBar
```

```{note}
This list of extensions gets out of date quickly, especially for VS Code.
