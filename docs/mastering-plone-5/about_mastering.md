# About Mastering Plone

This training was initially created by Philip Bauer and Patrick Gerken of [starzel.de](https://www.starzel.de) to create
a canonical training for future Plone developers.

The aim is that anyone with the appropriate knowledge can give a training based on it and contribute to it.
It is published as Open Source on [GitHub](https://github.com/plone/training) and {doc}`index`.
