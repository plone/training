# Deploying the Project

## Project Stack

This guide outlines the steps to deploy the project using a Docker stack comprising:

- **Traefik:** A router and SSL termination tool, integrated with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) for complimentary SSL certificates.
- **Plone Frontend using Volto:** A service based on React for the frontend.
- **Plone Backend:** The API service.
- **Postgres 14 Database:** Handles data persistence.

You can find this stack at {file}`devops/stacks/ploneconf2024-<your-github-username>.tangrama.com.br.yml`. It's modular, allowing easy integration of additional services like {term}`Varnish`, `Solr`, or `ElasticSearch`.

```

## Building Docker Images

Ensure you build the Docker images for the Frontend and Backend servers before deployment.
GitHub Actions, configured in {file}`.github/workflows/backend.yml` and {file}`.github/workflows/frontend.yml`, facilitate this process.

````{important}
Before deploying, run the following commands from your project's root directory to format the code and run tests.

```shell
make check
make test
```

The output from `make test` may vary according to changes in code.
The following console output indicates that no tests were run, and prompts you to choose an action.

```console
No tests found related to files changed since last commit.
Press `a` to run all tests, or run Jest with `--watchAll`.

Watch Usage
 › Press a to run all tests.
 › Press f to run only failed tests.
 › Press p to filter by a filename regex pattern.
 › Press t to filter by a test name regex pattern.
 › Press q to quit watch mode.
 › Press Enter to trigger a test run.
```

After these commands succeed, commit all code changes, push to GitHub, and ensure all GitHub Actions successfully complete their runs.
````


## Manual Deployment with `devops/Makefile`

Utilize the {file}`Makefile` at {file}`devops/Makefile` for manual deployment.

### Deploying the Stack

Execute the following command from your project's {file}`devops` directory to deploy the stack defined in {file}`devops/stacks/ploneconf2024-<your-github-username>.tangrama.com.br.yml` to the remote server.

```shell
make stack-deploy
```

### Verifying Stack Status

To check the status of all services in your stack, run:

```shell
make stack-status
```

### Creating Plone Site

On the initial deployment, the frontend containers might be unhealthy due to the unconfigured Plone site on the backend. Create a new site with:

```shell
make stack-create-site
```

### Monitoring Logs

Monitor the logs of each service with these commands:

-   Traefik: `make stack-logs-webserver`
-   Frontend: `make stack-logs-frontend`
-   Backend: `make stack-logs-backend`
-   Backend: `make stack-logs-db`

## Automating Deployment with GitHub Actions

{term}`cookieplone` includes a GitHub Actions Workflow, located at {file}`.github/workflows/manual_deploy.yml`, enabling deployment directly from the GitHub UI.

### Repository Configuration

#### Creating a New Environment

```{important}
If you can't see the {guilabel}`Environment` option on the left in the {guilabel}`Settings` of your GitHub repository, you may have a private repository in a free account.
You must either have a public repository or a [GitHub Team plan](https://github.com/pricing#compare-features) or a [GitHub Pro plan](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/githubs-plans) for a private repository.
If you use a free additional organization under control of a paid GitHub account, the {guilabel}`Environment` will also not be visible.
```

1. Log in to [GitHub](https://github.com/).
2. Navigate to the project repository.
3. Click `Settings`.
4. Select `Environments`, then `New environment`.
5. Name it after the public URL of the deployment server and configure the environment.

```{seealso}
In the generated project's file {file}`devops/README-GHA.md`, you can find the exact values to use for your project when completing the {guilabel}`New environment` form.
```

#### Adding Environment Secrets

Add secrets in the `Secrets` section of your environment. Refer to the table below:

| Secret Name | Secret Value                                             | Description                                               |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| DEPLOY_HOST | Your hostname or IP                                      | The Docker Swarm manager's address.                       |
| DEPLOY_PORT | 22                                                       | The SSHD port.                                            |
| DEPLOY_USER | Your username                                            | A user with Docker command permissions.                   |
| DEPLOY_SSH  | Content of {file}`devops/etc/keys/plone_prod_deploy_rsa` | The private SSH key for connection.                       |
| ENV_FILE    | Content of {file}`devops/.env_file_gha`                  | File containing environment variables for the stack file. |

#### Adding Repository Variables

Navigate to {menuselection}`Settings --> Secrets and Variables --> Actions`. Under {guilabel}`Variables`, add the repository variable:

| Name     | Value |
|----------|-------|
| LIVE_ENV | The name of the earlier created environment |

This variable is referenced in {file}`.github/workflows/manual_deploy.yml`.

## Initiating Manual Deployment

Ensure both Backend and Frontend tests are successful and images for both servers are available.

1. Go to the project's repository on GitHub.
2. Click the {guilabel}`Actions` tab.
3. Find {guilabel}`Manual Deployment...` and click {guilabel}`Run workflow`.
4. Select {guilabel}`Branch: main` under {guilabel}`Use workflow from`.
5. Press {guilabel}`Run workflow`.

The workflow connects to `DEPLOY_HOST` using `DEPLOY_USER` and `DEPLOY_SSH` key, initiates a new deployment using the specified stack, and provides a detailed deployment report.

## Accessing the Site

Your site should now be accessible via the defined public URL.

Note: Ensure you replace placeholders, such as `<url>`, with actual values per your project's specifics. Also, ensure that the paths to files and directories are correct and exist in your project structure.
