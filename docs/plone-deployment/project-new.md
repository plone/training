# Create a new Project

As highlighted in the {doc}`intro`'s Training Choices, GitHub is essential for building Docker images automatically in this training.
The steps can be adapted for other providers like GitLab.

## Generating the Codebase

Execute `cookiecutter` to generate a Plone project skeleton using the Cookiecutter {term}`cookiecutter-plone-starter` with the command below.

```shell
pipx run cookiecutter gh:collective/cookiecutter-plone-starter
```

Answer the prompts as they appear. You can either accept the default values or enter your own.

```{warning}
For participants of **Plone Conference 2023**, please use the following settings:

- `Project Title`: **Plone Conference Training**
- `Project Slug`: **ploneconf2023**
- `Project URL`: **ploneconf2023-\<your-github-username\>.tangrama.com.br**
- `GitHub User or Organization`: **\<your-github-username\>**
```

An example interaction with the `cookiecutter-plone-starter` wizard is shown below:

```{code-block} console

Navigate to your project directory:

```shell
cd ploneconf2023-<your-github-username>
```

### Understanding the Codebase

- {file}`/.github/workflows`: Contains GitHub Actions workflows for code testing and container image release.
- {file}`/backend`: Holds the backend (API) solution with Python codebase located in {file}`src/plone_conference`.
- {file}`/frontend`: Contains the frontend (Volto) solution generated by `@plone/generator-volto`.
- {file}`/devops`: Stores Ansible and Docker Stacks.
- {file}`/Makefile`: Defines tasks for codebase management.

We employ [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) for its reliability, widespread availability, and maturity. Future plans include enhancing make's dependency management and capabilities.

View all available commands and descriptions with:

```shell
make help
```

## Installing the Codebase and Dependencies

Install both the Plone backend and frontend with:

```shell
make install
```

This process will take a few minutes. Once completed, a success message will appear.

### Code Formatting and i18n

Ensure all tests pass on GitHub Actions after pushing the repository by running:

```shell
make format
```

Due to output differences in translations built by `@plone/generator-volto`, execute the following in the root directory:

```shell
make i18n
```

## Create a Repository on GitHub

### 1. **Login to GitHub**

Visit [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in.

### 2. **Create a New Repository**

Click the '+' icon in the upper right corner, select 'New repository', and fill in the details:

- **Repository name:** ploneconf2023
- **Description:** Plone Conference 2023 Training
- **Visibility:** Public

Click 'Create repository'.

## Initialize and Push to the Git Repository

### 1. **Initialize Git**

Initializes a new Git repository and begins tracking an existing directory.

```shell
git init .
```
### 2. **Add Files**

stages changes for commit, meaning it tracks the new files (in this case, all files in the directory with `.`). Staging lets you select which changes you want to commit.

```shell
git add .
```

### 3. **Initial Commit**

Saves the staged changes along with a brief log message describing the changes.
Replace `"Initial commit"` with a descriptive message if needed. It's the first commit,
so we typically label it as the "Initial commit."

```shell
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

### 4. **Link Local Repository to Remote Repository**

Connect your local repository to the remote server. First replace `<your-github-username>` with your actual GitHub username.
'origin' is the default name given to the remote repository, and we also set the default branch to be `main`.

```shell
git remote add origin git@github.com:<your-github-username>/ploneconf2023.git
git branch -M main
```

### 4. **Push to GitHub**

Push your commits to the remote repository hosted on GitHub. This command will trigger the GitHub Actions that test the codebase and
generate Docker images for the Backend and for the Frontend.

```shell
git push -u origin main
```
