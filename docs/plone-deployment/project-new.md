# Create a new Project

As highlighted in the {doc}`intro`'s {ref}`deployment-training-choices`, GitHub is essential for building Docker images automatically in this training.
The steps can be adapted for other providers like GitLab.

## Generating the Codebase

Execute `Cookieplone` to generate a Plone project skeleton with the command below.

```shell
pipx run cookieplone project
```

Answer the prompts as they appear. You can either accept the default values or enter your own.

```{warning}
For participants in **Plone Conference 2024**, please use the following settings:

-   {guilabel}`Project Title`: **Plone Conference Training**
-   {guilabel}`Project Slug`: **ploneconf2024**
-   {guilabel}`Project URL`: **ploneconf2024-\<your-github-username\>.tangrama.com.br**
-   {guilabel}`GitHub Username or Organization`: **\<your-github-username\>**
```

An example interaction with the `Cookieplone` wizard is shown below:

```{code-block} console

Navigate to your project directory:

```shell
cd ploneconf2024
```

### Understanding the Codebase

- {file}`/.github/workflows`: Contains GitHub Actions workflows for code testing and container image release.
- {file}`/backend`: Holds the backend (API) solution with Python codebase located in {file}`src/plone_conference`.
- {file}`/frontend`: Contains the frontend (Volto) solution generated by `@plone/generator-volto`.
- {file}`/devops`: Stores Ansible and Docker Stacks.
- {file}`/Makefile`: Defines tasks for codebase management.

We employ [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) for its reliability, widespread availability, and maturity. Future plans include enhancing make's dependency management and capabilities.

View all available commands and descriptions with:

```shell
make help
```

## Installing the Codebase and Dependencies

Install both the Plone backend and frontend with:

```shell
make install
```

This process will take a few minutes. Once completed, a success message will appear.

### Code Formatting and i18n

Ensure all tests pass on GitHub Actions after pushing the repository by running:

```shell
make check
```

## Create a Repository on GitHub

### 1. Login to GitHub

Visit [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in.

### 2. Create a New Repository

Click the '+' icon in the upper right corner, select 'New repository', and fill in the details:

-   {guilabel}`Repository name`: `ploneconf2024`
-   {guilabel}`Description`: `Plone Conference 2024 Training`
-   {guilabel}`Visibility`: `Public`

Click 'Create repository'.

## Initialize and Push to the Git Repository

### 1. Initialize Git

Initializes a new Git repository and begins tracking an existing directory.

```shell
git init .
```
### 2. Add Files

stages changes for commit, meaning it tracks the new files (in this case, all files in the directory with `.`). Staging lets you select which changes you want to commit.

```shell
git add .
```

### 3. Initial Commit

Saves the staged changes along with a brief log message describing the changes.
Replace "`Initial commit`" with a descriptive message if needed. It's the first commit,
so we typically label it as the "Initial commit."

```shell
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

### 4. Link Local Repository to Remote Repository

Connect your local repository to the remote server. First replace `<your-github-username>` with your actual GitHub username.
`origin` is the default name given to the remote repository, and we also set the default branch to be `main`.

```shell
git remote add origin git@github.com:<your-github-username>/ploneconf2024.git
git branch -M main
```

### 4. Push to GitHub

Push your commits to the remote repository hosted on GitHub. This command will trigger the GitHub Actions that test the codebase and
generate Docker images for the Backend and for the Frontend.

```shell
git push -u origin main
```
