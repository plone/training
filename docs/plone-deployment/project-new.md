# Create a new project

As highlighted in the {doc}`intro`'s {ref}`deployment-training-choices`, GitHub is essential for building Docker images automatically in this training.
The steps can be adapted for other providers, including GitLab.

## Generate the codebase

```{note}
This training session as of October 2025 will use an experimental branch of `cookieplone-templates`.
```

Execute `cookieplone` to generate a Plone project skeleton with the command below.

```shell
COOKIEPLONE_REPOSITORY_TAG=project-profiles uvx cookieplone project
```

Answer the prompts as they appear. You can either accept the default values or enter your own.

```{warning}

### Understanding the code base

- {file}`/.github/workflows`: Contains GitHub Actions workflows for code testing and container image release.
- {file}`/backend`: Holds the backend (API) solution with Python code base located in {file}`src/plone_conference`.
- {file}`/frontend`: Contains the frontend (Volto) solution generated by `@plone/generator-volto`.
- {file}`/devops`: Stores Ansible and Docker stacks.
- {file}`/Makefile`: Defines tasks for code base management.

We employ [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) for its reliability, widespread availability, and maturity. Future plans include enhancing make's dependency management and capabilities.

View all available commands and descriptions with:

```shell
make help
```

## Installing the code base and dependencies

Install both the Plone backend and frontend with:

```shell
make install
```

This process will take a few minutes. Once completed, a success message will appear. Both the frontend and backend in their respective directories will be built. 

For the frontend, the Node.js version will be used that you activated in the previous chapter with `nvm use --lts`. For the backend Python version, uv will check a `requires-python` key in the {file}`pyproject.toml` file. Or you can create a {file}`.python-version` file in the {file}`backend` folder.

Putting too specific Node.js and Python versions in the scaffolded project setup can cause other issues.
That's why the project generator gives hints for versions with ranges or `LTS`. But it is your own choice and responsibility to check for the correct major versions of both programming languages are active and available before you run `make install` in the project root or frontend and backend subdirectories for the first time. 

### Code formatting and i18n

Ensure all tests pass on GitHub Actions after pushing the repository by running:

```shell
make check
```

Also update all the translation files by running:

```shell
make i18n
```

## Create a repository on GitHub

```{warning}
You must either have a public repository, or a [GitHub Team plan](https://github.com/pricing#compare-features) or a [GitHub Pro plan](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/githubs-plans) for a private repository.
Otherwise you will not see the {guilabel}`Environment` option in {guilabel}`Settings`, which is required for setting up the secrets and variables for the GitHub Actions.`
```

### 1. Login to GitHub

Visit [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in.

### 2. Create a new repository

Click the `+` icon in the upper right corner, select `New repository`, and fill in the details:

-   {guilabel}`Repository name`: `ploneconf2025`
-   {guilabel}`Description`: `Plone Conference 2025 Training`
-   {guilabel}`Visibility`: `Public`

Click {guilabel}`Create repository`.

## Initialize and push to the Git repository

### 1. Initialize your project

Cookieplone already initializes a Git repository for you.
Make sure that you ran `make check` and `make i18n`.

### 2. Add files

Stage changes to commit in the current directory.
Staging lets you select which changes you want to commit.

```shell
git add .
```

### 3. Initial commit

Save the staged changes, along with a brief log message describing the changes.
Replace `Initial commit` with a descriptive message, if needed.
For the first commit, we typically label it as `Initial commit`.

```shell
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

### 4. Link local repository to remote repository

Connect your local repository to the remote server. First replace `<your-github-username>` with your actual GitHub username.
`origin` is the default name given to the remote repository.
Also set the default branch to `main`.

```shell
git remote add origin git@github.com:<your-github-username>/ploneconf2025.git
git branch -M main
```

### 5. Push to GitHub

Push your commits to the remote repository hosted on GitHub.
This command will trigger the GitHub Actions that test the codebase and generate Docker images for the backend and for the frontend.

```shell
git push -u origin main
```
