Custom Search
=============

..  warning::

    Skip this since eea.facettednavigation is not yet compatible with Plone 5.


We can use the indexes we created in the last chapter to further improve the talk list.

If the chapters about views seem complex, the custom search addon shown below might be a great alternative until you feel comfortable writing views and templates. There are several tools that allow you to add amazing custom searches and content listings through the web in Plone.

eea.facetednavigation
---------------------

* Install `eea.facetednavigation <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/eea.facetednavigation/>`_
* Enable faceted navigation on a new folder "Discover talks" by clicking on *actions* > *Enable faceted navigation*
* Click on the tab *Faceted criteria* to configure it

    * Select 'Talk' for *Portal type*, hide *Results per page*
    * Add a checkboxes widget to the left and use the catalog index *Audience* for it.
    * Add a select widget for speaker

    We use the new catalog indexes to provide the data for the widgets and search the results. For other use cases we could also use either the built-in vocabularies (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.app.vocabularies) or create custom vocabularies for this.

    * Custom vocabularies ttw using `Products.ATVocabularyManager <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.ATVocabularyManager>`_
    * Programming using Vocabularies: http://docs.plone.org/external/plone.app.dexterity/docs/advanced/vocabularies.html
