=============================
Introduction To Diazo Theming
=============================

In this section you will:

* Use the :guilabel:`Theming` control panel to make a copy of Plone's default theme (barceloneta)
* Customize a theme using Diazo rules
* Customize a theme by editing and compiling Less files

Topics covered:

* Diazo and :py:mod:`plone.app.theming`
* "Barceloneta" - The Default Plone Theme
* The "Theming tool"
* Building CSS in the "Theming tool"
* ``<body>`` element CSS classes
* Conditionally activating rules

Installation
============

We will use a `Plone pre-configured Heroku instance <https://github.com/collective/training-sandbox>`_.

Once deployed, create a Plone site.

Two Approaches To Theming
=========================

There are two main approaches to creating a custom theme:

1. Copying the default Barceloneta theme
2. Inheriting from the default Barceloneta theme.

In this section we'll look at the first approach, part II will explore the second approach.

What Is Diazo?
==============

:program:`Diazo` is a theming engine used by Plone to make theming a site easier.
At its core, a Diazo theme consists of an HTML page and :file:`rules.xml` file containing directives.

.. note::

    You can find extended information about Diazo and its integration package :py:mod:`plone.app.theming`
    in the official docs: `Diazo docs <http://docs.diazo.org/en/latest/>`_ and
    `plone.app.theming docs <https://docs.plone.org/external/plone.app.theming/docs/index.html#what-is-a-diazo-theme>`_.

Principles
==========

For this part of the training you need to know the basic principles of a Diazo theme:

* Plone renders the content of the page;
* Diazo rules inject the content into any static theme.

Copy Barceloneta Theme
======================

To create our playground we will copy the existing Barceloneta theme.

1. Go to the :guilabel:`Theming` control panel
2. You will see the available themes. In a bare new Plone site, you will see something like this:

.. image:: _static/theming-bare_plone_themes_list.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Picture of available themes in control panel

3. Click on the :guilabel:`Copy` button and get to the copy form
4. Insert "My theme" as the name and activate it by default

.. image:: _static/theming-copy_theme_form.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Example how to copy a theme

5. Click on :guilabel:`Create` and you get redirected to your new theme's inspector:

.. image:: _static/theming-just_copied_theme_inspector.png
   :align: center
   :alt: result of copied theme


Anatomy Of A Diazo Theme
========================

The most important files:

* :file:`manifest.cfg`: contains metadata about the theme (`manifest reference <https://docs.plone.org/external/plone.app.theming/docs/index.html#the-manifest-file>`_);
* :file:`rules.xml`: contains the theme rules (`rules reference <https://docs.plone.org/external/plone.app.theming/docs/index.html#rules-syntax>`_);
* :file:`index.html`: the static HTML of the theme.

Exercise 1 - Inspecting the :file:`manifest.cfg`
------------------------------------------------

To better understand how your theme is arranged, start by reading the :file:`manifest.cfg` file.

In the theming tool, open :file:`manifest.cfg` spend a minute or two looking through it, then
see if you can answer the questions below.

Where are the main rules located for your theme?

What property in the :file:`manifest.cfg` file defines the source CSS/Less file used by the theme?

What do you think is the purpose of the ``prefix`` property?

.. admonition:: Solution
    :class: toggle

    The main rules are defined by the ``rules`` property (you could point this anywhere, however the accepted convention is to use a file named :file:`rules.xml`.

    The ``development-css`` property points at the main Less file, when compiled to CSS it is placed
    in the location defined by the ``production-css`` property.

    The ``prefix`` property defines the default location to look for non-prefixed files, for example
    if your prefix is set to ``/++theme++mytheme`` then a file like :file:`index.html` will be expected at
    ``/++theme++mytheme/index.html``


``<body>`` CSS Classes
======================

As you browse a Plone site, Plone adds rich information about your current context.
This information is represented as special classes in the ``<body>`` element.
Information represented by the ``<body>`` classes includes:

- the current user role, and permissions,
- the current content-type and its template,
- the site section and sub section,
- the current subsite (if any),
- whether this is a frontend view,
- whether icons are enabled.

``<body>`` Classes For An Anonymous Visitor
-------------------------------------------

Below you can see an example of the body classes for a page named "front-page", located in the root of a typical Plone site called "acme":

.. code-block:: html

    <body class="template-document_view
                 portaltype-document
                 site-acme
                 section-front-page
                 icons-on
                 thumbs-on
                 frontend
                 viewpermission-view
                 userrole-anonymous">

``<body>`` Classes For A Manager
--------------------------------

And here is what the classes for the same page look like when viewed by a manager that has logged in:

.. code-block:: html

    <body class="template-document_view
                 portaltype-document
                 site-acme
                 section-front-page
                 icons-on
                 thumbs-on
                 frontend
                 viewpermission-view
                 userrole-member
                 userrole-manager
                 userrole-authenticated
                 plone-toolbar-left
                 plone-toolbar-expanded
                 plone-toolbar-left-expanded">

Notice the addition of ``userrole-manager``.

Exercise 2 - Discussion about the ``<body>`` classes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Look back at the ``<body>`` classes for a manager, then see if you can answer the following questions.

1. What other roles does the manager have?
2. Can you see other differences?
3. What do you think the ``plone-toolbar-expanded`` class does?

.. admonition:: Solution
    :class: toggle

    The manager also has the role "member" and "authenticated"

    There are ``plone-toolbar`` classes added to the ``<body>`` element, these control the display of the toolbar

    The ``plone-toolbar-expanded`` class is used to control styles used by the expanded version of the toolbar.


Custom Rules
============

Let's open :file:`rules.xml`. You will see all the rules that are used in the Barceloneta theme right now.
For the time being let's concentrate on how to hack these rules.

Conditionally Showing Content
-----------------------------

.. image:: _static/theming-viewlet-above-content-in-plone-site.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Add a viewlet above content

Suppose that we want to make the "above content" block (the one that contains breadcrumbs) conditional, and show it only for authenticated users.

In the :file:`rules.xml` find this line:

.. code-block:: xml

    <replace css:content="#viewlet-above-content" css:theme="#above-content" />

This rule states that the element that comes from the content (Plone) with the id ``#viewlet-above-content`` must replace the element with the id ``#above-content`` in the static theme.

We want to hide it for anonymous users  (hint: We'll use the ``<body>`` classses discussed above).

The class we are looking for is ``userrole-authenticated``. Add another property to the rule so that we produce this code:

.. code-block:: xml

    <replace
        css:if-content="body.userrole-authenticated"
        css:content="#viewlet-above-content"
        css:theme="#above-content" />

The attribute ``css:if-content`` allows us to put a condition on the rules based on a CSS selector that acts on the content.
In this way the rule will be applied only if the body element has the class ``.userrole-authenticated``.

We will learn more about Diazo rules in :doc:`ttw-advanced-2`.


Customize CSS
=============

1. From theming tool open the file :file:`less/barceloneta.plone.less`, that is the main Less file as specified in the manifest;
2. Add your own customization at the bottom, like:

.. code-block:: css

    body{ background-color: red; font-size: 18px ;};

.. Note::

   Normally you would place this in a separate file to keep the main one clean but for this example it is enough.

3. Push the buttons :guilabel:`Save` and :guilabel:`Build CSS`

.. image:: _static/theming-editor_compile_css.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Build CSS

4. Go back to the Plone site and reload the page: voil√°!


..  Warning::

    At the moment you need to "Build CSS" from the main file, the one declared in the manifest (in this case :file:`less/barceloneta.plone.less`).

    Whatever Less file you edit, go back to the main one to compile. This behavior will be improved but for now, just remember this simple rule ;)
