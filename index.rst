Welcome to Mastering Plone's documentation!
===========================================

This is the documentation for the "Mastering Plone"-training.

Mastering Plone is intended as a week-long training for people who are new to Plone or want to learn about the current best-practices of Plone-development. It can be split in two tranings:

- A beginner training (2 to 3 days) that covers chapters 1-18.
- A advanced training (3 to 5 days) that covers the rest.

Please note that this document is not complete without the spoken word of a trainer even though we attempt to include the most important parts of what we teach in the narrative it can not be considered complete without the spoken word.
