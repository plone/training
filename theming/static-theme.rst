Make it reproducible: static theme
==================================

You just created your shiny brand new theme :term:`TTW`.

.. note::

   For more TTW configuring and customizing options, see :ref:`ttw-label`.

Now, let's see how you can re-use it in another Plone site.

#. Go back to :guilabel:`Theming` control panel.
#. Click the :guilabel:`Download` button in the box of your theme.
#. The browser will download a zip file.
#. Go to the :term:`ZMI` root.
#. Create a new Plone site.
#. Go to the :guilabel:`Theming` control panel in that new Plone site.
#. Click on the :guilabel:`Upload zip file` button and select your downloaded theme.
#. Tick :guilabel:`Immediately enable new theme` and click on :guilabel:`Import`.
#. Go back to your Plone site: voilá!
