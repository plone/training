**Training Objective**

The most important objective of this training is to explain how to adjust the layout and design of a Plone site.
It will cover basic customizations you can do :term:`TTW` (Through-The-Web) in your Plone site,
as well as advanced theming methods and tools to create stunning themes for your Plone website based on existing HTML templates.


This training is **not** about:
