   Customize templates on the fly with collective.jbot

..  note::

    Not yet compatible with Plone 5!


Back in the old days we used to customize views' templates from the tool `portal_view_customizations` from the ZMI.

This tool has no UI (User Interface) and could beat you whenever you don't expect it.

`Nathan Van Gheem <https://twitter.com/vangheezy>`_ has created this package that unfortunately is not (yet!) part of the core: `collective.jbot <https://github.com/collective/collective.jbot>`_.

This package uses the well-known `z3c.jbot` under the hood and allows you to customize templates TTW (Through-The-Web) from the control panel.
