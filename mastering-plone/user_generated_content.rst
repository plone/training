How do prospective speakers submit talks? We let them register on the site and grant right to create talks. For this we go back to changing the site through-the-web.

In this chapter we:

* allow self-registration
* constrain types on the talk folder
* grant local roles
* create a custom workflow for talks


.. _user-content-self-reg-label:

Self-registration
-----------------

* Go to the Security control panel at http://localhost:8080/Plone/@@security-controlpanel and Enable self-registration
* Leave "Enable User Folders" off unless you want a community site.


.. _user-content-constrain-types-label:

Constrain types
---------------

* On the talk folder select `Restrictionsâ€¦ <http://localhost:8080/Plone/the-event/talks/folder_constraintypes_form>`_ from the *Add new* menu. Only allow to add talks.


.. _user-content-local-roles-label:

Grant local roles
-----------------

* Go to *Sharing* and grant the role *Can add* to the group logged-in users. Now every user can add content in this folder (and only this folder).

Now all logged-in users can create and submit talks in this folder with the permission of the default workflow.


.. _user-content-custom-workflow-label:

A custom workflow for talks
---------------------------

We still need to fix a problem: Authenticated users can see all talks, even the ones of other users in the private state. Since we don't want this we will create a modified workflow for talks. The new workflow will only let them see and edit talks they created themselves and not the ones of other users.

* Go to the :menuselection:`ZMI --> portal_workflow`
* See how talks have the same workflow as most content, namely :guilabel:`(Default)`
* Go to the tab :guilabel:`Contents`, check the box next to :guilabel:`simple_publication_workflow`, click :guilabel:`copy` and :guilabel:`paste`.
* Rename the new workflow from *copy_of_simple_publication_workflow* to *talks_workflow*.
* Edit the workflow by clicking on it: Change the Title to *Talks Workflow*.
* Click on the tab :guilabel:`States` and click on :guilabel:`private` to edit this state. In the next view select the tab :guilabel:`Permissions`.
* Find the table column for the role :guilabel:`Contributor` and remove the permissions for :guilabel:`Access contents information` and :guilabel:`View`. Note that the :guilabel:`Owner` (i.e. the Creator) still has some permissions.
* Do the same for the state :guilabel:`pending`
* Go back to :file:`portal_workflow` and set the new workflow :file:`talks_workflow` for talks. Click :file:`Change` and then :file:`Update security settings`.

.. note::

    The add-on `plone.app.workflowmanager <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.app.workflowmanager>`_ provides a much nicer user-interface for this. The problem is you need a big screen for it and it can be pretty confusing as well.

Done.


.. _user-content-fs-label:

Move the changes to the file system
-----------------------------------

We don't want to do these steps for every new conference by hand so we move the changes into our package.

Import/Export the Workflow
**************************

* export the GenericSetup step *Workflow Tool* in http://localhost:8080/Plone/portal_setup/manage_exportSteps.
* drop the file :file:`workflows.xml` into :file:`profiles/default` an clean out everything that is not related to talks.

  .. code-block:: xml

      <?xml version="1.0"?>
      <object name="portal_workflow" meta_type="Plone Workflow Tool">
       <object name="talks_workflow" meta_type="Workflow"/>
       <bindings>
        <type type_id="talk">
         <bound-workflow workflow_id="talks_workflow"/>
        </type>
       </bindings>
      </object>

* drop :file:`workflows/talks_workflow/definition.xml` in :file:`profiles/default/workflows/talks_workflow/definition.xml`. The other files are just definitions of the default-workflows and we only want things in our package that changes Plone.


Enable self-registration
************************

To enable self-registration you need to change the global setting that controls this option.
Most global setting are stored in the registry. You can modify it by adding following to :file:`profiles/default/registry.xml`:

..  code-block:: xml

    <record name="plone.enable_self_reg">
      <value>True</value>
    </record>


Grant local roles
*****************

Since the granting of local roles applies only to a certain folder in the site we would not always write code for it but do it by hand. But for testability and repeatability (there is a conference every year!) we should create the initial content structure automatically.

So let's make sure some initial content is created and configured on installing the package.

To run arbitrary code during the installation of a package we use a `post_handler <https://docs.plone.org/develop/addons/components/genericsetup.html#custom-installer-code-setuphandlers-py>`_

Our package already has such an method registered in :file:`configure.zcml`. It will be automatically run when (re-)installing the add-on.

..  code-block:: xml
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 7

    <genericsetup:registerProfile
        name="default"
        title="ploneconf.site"
        directory="profiles/default"
        description="Installs the ploneconf.site add-on."
        provides="Products.GenericSetup.interfaces.EXTENSION"
        post_handler=".setuphandlers.post_install"
        />

This makes sure the method :py:meth:`post_install` in :file:`setuphandlers.py` is executed after the installation. The method already exists doing nothing. You need to extend it to do what we want.

    def uninstall(context):
        """Uninstall script"""
        # Do something at the end of the uninstallation of this package.

Once we reinstall our package a folder :file:`talks` is created with the appropriate local roles and constraints.

We wrote similar code to create the folder *The Event* in :ref:`dexterity2-upgrades-label`.
We need it to make sure a sane structure gets created when we create a new site by hand or in tests.

You would usually create a list of dictionaries containing the type, parent and title plus optionally layout, workflow state etc. to create an initial structure. In some projects it could also make sense to have a separate profile besides ``default`` which might be called ``demo`` or ``content`` that creates an initial structure and maybe another ``testing`` that creates dummy content (talks, speakers etc) for tests.


Exercise 1
++++++++++

Create a profile ``content`` that runs its own post_handler in :file:`setuphandlers.py`.

..  admonition:: Solution
    :class: toggle

    Register the profile and the upgrade step in :file:`configure.zcml`

    .. code-block:: xml

        <genericsetup:registerProfile
            name="content"
            title="PloneConf Site initial content"
            directory="profiles/content"
            description="Extension profile for PloneConf Talk to add initial content"
            provides="Products.GenericSetup.interfaces.EXTENSION"
            post_handler=".setuphandlers.post_content"
            />

    Also add a :file:`profiles/content/metadata.xml` so the default profile gets automatically installed when installing the content profile.

    ..  code-block:: xml

        <metadata>
          <version>1000</version>
          <dependencies>
            <dependency>profile-ploneconf.site:default</dependency>
          </dependencies>
        </metadata>


    Add the structure you wish to create as a list of dictionaries in :file:`setuphandlers.py`:

    ..  code-block:: python
        :linenos:

        STRUCTURE = [
            {

        ]


    Add the method :py:meth:`content` to :file:`setuphandlers.py`. We pointed to that when registering the import step. And add some fancy logic to create the content from ``STRUCTURE``.

    ..  code-block:: python
        :linenos:

        from zope.lifecycleevent import modified


        def post_content(context):
            portal = api.portal.get()
            for item in STRUCTURE:
                _create_content(item, portal)


        def _create_content(item_dict, container, force=False):
            if not force and container.get(item_dict['id'], None) is not None:
                return

            # Extract info that can't be passed to api.content.create
            layout = item_dict.pop('layout', None)
            default_page = item_dict.pop('default_page', None)
            allowed_types = item_dict.pop('allowed_types', None)
            local_roles = item_dict.pop('local_roles', [])
            children = item_dict.pop('children', [])
            state = item_dict.pop('state', None)

            new = api.content.create(
                container=container,
                safe_id=True,
                **item_dict
            )
            logger.info('Created {0} at {1}'.format(new.portal_type, new.absolute_url()))

            if layout is not None:
                new.setLayout(layout)
            if default_page is not None:
                new.setDefaultPage(default_page)
            if allowed_types is not None:
                _constrain(new, allowed_types)
            for local_role in local_roles:
                api.group.grant_roles(
                    groupname=local_role['group'],
                    roles=local_role['roles'],
                    obj=new)
            if state is not None:
                api.content.transition(new, to_state=state)

            modified(new)
            # call recursively for children
            for subitem in children:
                _create_content(subitem, new)


        def _constrain(context, allowed_types):
            behavior = constrains.ISelectableConstrainTypes(context)
            behavior.setConstrainTypesMode(constrains.ENABLED)
            behavior.setLocallyAllowedTypes(allowed_types)
            behavior.setImmediatelyAddableTypes(allowed_types)

    A huge benefit of this implementation is that you can add any object-attribute as a new item to :py:data:`item_dict`. :py:meth:`plone.api.content.create` will then set these on the new objects. This way you can also populate fields like :py:attr:`text` (using :py:class:`plone.app.textfield.RichTextValue`) or :py:attr:`image` (using :py:class:`plone.namedfile.file.NamedBlobImage`).
