.. sidebar:: Volto chapter

  .. figure:: _static/volto.svg
     :alt: Volto Logo

  This chapter is about the React frontend Volto.


.. sidebar:: Get the code! (:doc:`More info <code>`)

   Code for the beginning of this chapter::

       git checkout TODO tag to checkout

   Code for the end of this chapter::

        git checkout TODO tag to checkout


To be solved task in this part:

* Grant access to voting for the Volto frontend

In this part you will:

* Register and write a custom endpoint

Topics covered:

* Extending plone.restapi
* Services and Endpoints


Out of the box Volto has no access to the logic for voting created in the last chapter.

You need to extend a endpoint that can be used by GET, POST and DELETE requests.

The adapter ``starzel.votable_behavior.behavior.voting.Vote`` has the logic needed for voting, the key features are ``votes`` to get the current votes, ``vote`` to actively cast a vote and ``clear`` to clear existing votes.

For the classic frontend this api is exposed in a Viewlet (see chapter :ref:`viewlets2-label`).
But neither the adapter nor the viewlet is directly accessible by a react frontend.

In :file:`backend/src/starzel.votable_behavior/starzel/votable_behavior/` create a folder :file:`restapi` with a empty :file:`__init__.py`.
In that new folder create a :file:`configure.zcml` where you will register the endpoints.

Don't forget to register the new file in the packages' main :file:`configure.zcml`:

.. code-block:: xml
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 2

  <include package=".browser" />
  <include package=".restapi" />


Now register the endpoints you plan to write in :file:`restapi/configure.zcml`:

.. code-block:: xml
    :linenos:

    <configure
        xmlns="http://namespaces.zope.org/zope"
        xmlns:plone="http://namespaces.plone.org/plone"
        xmlns:zcml="http://namespaces.zope.org/zcml">

      <plone:service
        method="GET"
        name="@votes"
        for="starzel.votable_behavior.interfaces.IVotable"
        factory=".voting.Votes"
        permission="zope2.View"
        />

      <plone:service
        method="POST"
        name="@votes"
        for="starzel.votable_behavior.interfaces.IVotable"
        factory=".voting.Vote"
        permission="zope2.View"
        />

      <plone:service
        method="DELETE"
        name="@votes"
        for="starzel.votable_behavior.interfaces.IVotable"
        factory=".voting.Delete"
        permission="zope2.View"
        />

    </configure>

Note that are all have the same name ``@votes`` but will provide different functionality depending on the method of the request.
This is not required but a convention many endpoints follow.
We could also name them mnore in sync with their functionality.
In our example the permission-checks are delegated to the services themselves and we use ``zope2.View`` as permission.
The services are all only available on content that provides the marker-interface ``starzel.votable_behavior.interfaces.IVotable`` that we added in the last chapter via a behavior.

Now create the :file:`voting.py` and write the services that together make the endpoint ``@votes``:

.. code-block:: python

    class Vote(Service):

        def reply(self):

            can_vote = not api.user.is_anonymous() and api.user.has_permission(DoVote, obj=self.context)
            if not can_vote:
                raise Unauthorized("User not authorized to vote.")
            voting = IVoting(self.context)
            data = json_body(self.request)
            vote = data['rating']
            voting.vote(vote, self.request)

            return vote_info(self.context, self.request)


    class Delete(Service):
        """Unlock an object"""

        def reply(self):
            alsoProvides(self.request, IDisableCSRFProtection)
            can_vote = not api.user.is_anonymous() and api.user.has_permission(DoVote, obj=self.context)
            if not can_vote:
                raise Unauthorized("User not authorized to delete votes.")
            voting = IVoting(self.context)
            voting.clear()
            return vote_info(self.context, self.request)


    class Votes(Service):
        """Voting information about the current object"""

        def reply(self):
            return vote_info(self.context, self.request)


    def vote_info(obj, request=None):
        """Returns voting information about the given object."""
        if not request:
            request = getRequest()
        voting = IVoting(obj)
        can_vote = not api.user.is_anonymous() and api.user.has_permission(DoVote, obj=obj)
        can_clear_votes = any(role in api.user.get_roles() for role in ['Manager', 'Site Manager'])
        info = {
            'average_vote': voting.average_vote(),
            'total_votes': voting.total_votes(),
            'has_votes': voting.has_votes(),
            'already_voted': voting.already_voted(request),
            'can_vote': can_vote,
            'can_clear_votes': can_clear_votes,
        }
        return info


This endpoint is modeled similar to the Locking endpoint of :py:module:`plone.restapi`: https://github.com/plone/plone.restapi/blob/master/src/plone/restapi/services/locking/locking.py
