About Mastering Plone
=====================

*Mastering Plone Development Training* is both: an online training and a handout for on-site trainings. We address developers. You are interested in best practice guides and want to learn the why and where, so read on!

The beginning and the continuation
----------------------------------

This training was initially started as a Plone Classic training and evolved now to a roundtrip on both: Plone Classic HOWTOs, same for the ReactJS frontend and the interplay between backend and frontend.

This training is published on `training.plone.org <https://training.plone.org/>`_.
The *Mastering Plone Development Training* is Open Source on `GitHub <https://github.com/plone/training>`_.
We update the training frequently to teach the best practices.
You are welcome to contribute and give feedback on `GitHub issues <https://github.com/plone/training/issues>`_.

Thank you for reading and your charity with non native speakers / writers.

.. _about-use-label:


Using the documentation for a training
---------------------------------------

Feel free to organize a training yourself.
Please be so kind to contribute any bug fixes or enhancements you made to the documentation for your training.

The training is rendered using Sphinx and builds in two flavors:

default
    The verbose version used for the online documentation and for the trainer.
    Build it in Sphinx with ``make html`` or use the online version.

presentation
    An abbreviated version used for the projector during a training.
    It should use more bullet points than verbose text.
    Build it in Sphinx with ``make presentation``.

.. note::

    By prefixing an indented block of text or code with ``.. only:: presentation`` you can control
    that this block is used for the presentation version only.

    To hide a block from the presentation version use ``.. only:: not presentation``

    Content without a prefix will be included in both versions.


The readthedocs theme
+++++++++++++++++++++

We slightly tweaked the `Read the Docs Theme <https://github.com/rtfd/sphinx_rtd_theme>`_
in ``_static/custom.css`` so that it works better with projectors:

- We start hiding the navigation bar much earlier so that it does not interfere with the text.
- We enlarge the default width of the content-area.

Exercises
++++++++++

Some additional JavaScript shows hidden solutions for exercises by clicking.

Prepend the solution with this markup::

    ..  admonition:: Solution
        :class: toggle

Here is a full example

.. code-block:: rst

    Exercise 1
    ^^^^^^^^^^

    Your mission, should you choose to accept it...

    ..  admonition:: This is the heading for the solution
        :class: toggle

        To save the world with only seconds to spare do the following:

        .. code-block:: python

            from plone import api

It will be rendered like this:

Exercise 1
^^^^^^^^^^

Your mission, should you choose to accept it...

..  admonition:: This is the heading for the solution
    :class: toggle

    To save the world with only seconds to spare do the following:

    .. code-block:: python

        from plone import api


Building the documentation locally
----------------------------------

Dependencies and new build
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Please make sure that you have `Enchant <https://abiword.github.io/enchant/>`_ installed. This is needed for spell-checking.

Install Enchant on macOS:

.. code-block:: console

    brew install enchant

Install Enchant on Ubuntu:

.. code-block:: console

    sudo apt-get install enchant


To build the documentation follow these steps:

.. code-block:: console

    git clone https://github.com/plone/training.git
    cd training
    python -m venv .
    source bin/activate

Now install dependencies and build.

.. code-block:: console

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    make html

You can now open the output ``_build/html/index.html`` in your browser.

To build the presentation version use ``make presentation`` instead of ``make html``. You can open the presentation at ``_build/presentation/index.html``.

If you use macOS you can do:

.. code-block:: console

    open _build/html/index.html

In the case of Linux, Ubuntu for example you can do:

.. code-block:: console

    firefox _build/html/index.html

or with Chrome

.. code-block:: console

    google-chrome _build/html/index.html


**All steps in short**

.. code-block:: console

    git clone https://github.com/plone/training.git
    cd training
    python -m venv .
    source bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    make html



Update existing
+++++++++++++++

.. code-block:: bash

    git pull
    source bin/activate
    make html
    open _build/html/index.html


Sync the browser while editing
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To watch the changes in browser while editing you can use gulp.

Install once the gulp command line utility.

.. code-block:: bash

    npm install --global gulp-cli

Install once the gulp project with

.. code-block:: bash

    npm install

Run gulp when starting working on the training with

.. code-block:: bash

    gulp

and see a browser window opening on http://localhost:3002/.


Technical set up to do before a training (as a trainer)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Prepare a mailserver for the user registration mail (See :ref:`features-mailserver-label`)
- If you do only a part of the training (Advanced) prepare a database with the steps of the previous sections. Be aware that the file- and blobstorage in the Vagrant box is here: /home/vagrant/var/ (not at the buildout path /vagrant/buildout/)


Upgrade the vagrant and buildout to a new Plone-version
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- In https://github.com/collective/training_buildout change `buildout.cfg <https://github.com/collective/training_buildout/blob/master/buildout.cfg>`_ to extend from the new `versions.cfg` on http://dist.plone.org/release
- Check if we should to update any versions in https://github.com/collective/training_buildout/blob/master/versions.cfg
- Commit and push the changes to the training_buildout
- Modify the vagrant-setup by modifying :file:`plone_training_config/manifests/plone.pp`. Set the new Plone-version as `$plone_version` in line 3.
- Test the vagrant-setup it by creating a new vagrant-box using the new config.
- Create a new zip-file of all files in `plone_training_config` and move it to `_static`:

.. code-block:: console

   cd plone_training_config
   zip -r ../_static/plone_training_config.zip *

- Commit and push the changes to https://github.com/plone/training


Train the trainer
-----------------

If you are a trainer there is a special mini training about giving technical trainings.
We really want this material to be used, re-used, expanded, and improved by Plone trainers world wide.

These chapters don't contain any Plone specific advice.
There's background, theory, check lists, and tips for anyone trying to teach technical subjects.
