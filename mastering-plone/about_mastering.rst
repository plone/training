About Mastering Plone
=====================

This training was created by Philip Bauer and Patrick Gerken of `starzel.de <https://www.starzel.de>`_ to create a canonical training for future Plone developers. The aim is that anyone with the appropriate knowledge can give a training based on it and contribute to it. It is published as Open Source on `github <https://github.com/plone/training>`_ and `training.plone.org <https://training.plone.org/>`_.

If you want to inquire the original authors about organizing a training please contact them at team@starzel.de.

The following trainers have given trainings based on Mastering Plone:

Philip Bauer
    Philip Bauer is a web developer from Munich who fell in love with Plone in 2005 and since then works almost exclusively with Plone.

Fulvio Casali
    Fulvio Casali has been working almost exclusively with Plone since 2008.

He loves participating in Plone community events, and organized two strategic Plone sprints on the northwest coast of the USA and helped galvanized the developer community there.

Johannes Raggam
    Johannes Raggam from Graz/Austria works most of the time with a technology stack based around Python, Plone, Pyramid and Javascript.

Using the documentation for a training
---------------------------------------

Feel free to organize a training yourself. Please be so kind to contribute any bug fixes or enhancements you made to the documentation for your training.

The training is rendered using sphinx and builds in two flavors:

default
    The verbose version used for the online documentation and for the trainer. Build it in sphinx with ``make html`` or use the online version.

presentation
    A abbreviated version used for the projector during a training. It should use more bullet points than verbose text. Build it in sphinx with ``make presentation``.

.. note::

    By prefixing an indented block of text or code with ``.. only:: presentation`` you can control that this block is used for the presentation version only.

    To hide a block from the presentation version use ``.. only:: not presentation``

    Content without a prefix will be included in both versions.


The readthedocs theme
+++++++++++++++++++++

We slightly tweaked readthedocs theme in ``_static/custom.css`` so that it works better with projectors:

- We start hiding the navigation bar much earlier so that it does not interfere with the text.
- We enlarge the default width of the content-area.

Exercises
++++++++++

Some additional javascript shows hidden solutions for exercises by clicking.

Just prepend the solution with this markup::

    ..  admonition:: Solution
        :class: toggle

Here is a full example::

    Exercise 1
    ^^^^^^^^^^

    Your mission, should you choose to accept it...

    ..  admonition:: Solution
        :class: toggle

        To save the world with only seconds to spare do the following:

        .. code-block:: python

            from plone import api

It will be rendered like this:

Exercise 1
^^^^^^^^^^

Your mission, should you choose to accept it...

..  admonition:: Solution
    :class: toggle

    To save the world with only seconds to spare do the following:

    .. code-block:: python

        from plone import api


Building the documentation locally
----------------------------------

Dependencies
++++++++++++

Please make sure that you have `Enchant <https://www.abisource.com/projects/enchant/>`_ installed, this is needed for spell-checking.

Install Enchant on OS X:

.. code-block:: bash

    brew install enchant

Install Enchant on Ubuntu:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install enchant


To build the documentation follow these steps:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/plone/training.git --recursive
    $ cd training
    $ virtualenv --python=python2.7 .
    $ source bin/activate

Now install dependencies and build.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ make html

You can now open the output from ``_build/html/index.html``. To build the presentation version use ``make presentation`` instead of ``make html``. You can open the presentation at ``presentation/index.html``.

Build new
---------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/plone/training.git --recursive
    $ cd training
    $ virtualenv --python=python2.7 .
    $ source bin/activate
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ make html

Now you can open documentation with your web-bowser.

If you use OS X you can just do:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ open _build/html/index.html

In the case of Linux, Ubuntu for example you can do:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ firefox _build/html/index.html

.. note::

    If you do not use Firefox but Chrome, please replace firefox with google-chrome e.g

.. code-block :: bash

    $ google-chrome _build/html/index.html




Update existing
+++++++++++++++

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git pull
    $ source bin/activate
    $ make html
    $ open _build/html/index.html


Technical set up to do before a training (as a trainer)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Prepare a mailserver for the user registration mail (See :ref:`features-mailserver-label`)
- If you do only a part of the training (Advanced) prepare a database with the steps of the previous sections. Be aware that the file- and blobstorage in the Vagrant box is here: /home/vagrant/var/ (not at the buildout path /vagrant/buildout/)


Upgrade the vagrant and buildout to a new Plone-version
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- In https://github.com/collective/training_buildout change `buildout.cfg <https://github.com/collective/training_buildout/blob/master/buildout.cfg>`_ to extend from the new `versions.cfg` on http://dist.plone.org/release
- Check if we should to update any versions in https://github.com/collective/training_buildout/blob/master/versions.cfg
- Commit and push the changes to the training_buildout
- Modify the vagrant-setup by modifying :file:`plone_training_config/manifests/plone.pp`. Set the new Plone-version as `$plone_version` in line 3.
- Test the vagrant-setup it by creating a new vagrant-box using the new config.
- Create a new zip-file of all files in `plone_training_config` and move it to `_static`:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ cd plone_training_config
        $ zip -r plone_training_config.zip *
        $ mv plone_training_config.zip ../_static/

- Commit and push the changes to https://github.com/plone/training


Train the trainer
-----------------

If you are a trainer there is a special mini training about giving technical trainings. We really want this material to be used, re-used, expanded and improved by Plone trainers world wide. These chapters don't contain any Plone specific advice, there's background, theory,  check lists and tips for anyone trying to teach technical subjects.
