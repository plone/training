#: ../reusable.rst:32
msgid "Permissions have a long history, there are two types of permissions."
msgstr ""

#: ../reusable.rst:34
msgid "In Zope2, a permission was just a string."
msgstr ""

#: ../reusable.rst:36
msgid "In ZTK, a permission is an object that gets registered as a Utility."
msgstr ""

#: ../reusable.rst:38
msgid "We must support both, in some cases we have to reference the permission by their Zope2 version, in some by their ZTK Version."
msgstr ""

#: ../reusable.rst:40
msgid "Luckily, there is a zcml statement to register a permission both ways in one step."
msgstr ""

#: ../reusable.rst:44
msgid "The configuration registry was meant to solve a problem, but we will now stumble over a problem that did not get resolved properly."
msgstr ""

#: ../reusable.rst:46
msgid "Our permission is a utility. Our browser views declare this permission as a requirement for viewing them."
msgstr ""

#: ../reusable.rst:48
msgid "When our browser views get registered, the permissions must exist already. If you try to register the permissions after the views, Zope won't start because it doesn't know about the permissions."
msgstr ""

#: ../reusable.rst:50
msgid "Let's modify the file :file:`configure.zcml`"
msgstr ""

#: ../reusable.rst:78
msgid "In some places we have to reference the Zope 2 permission strings. It is best practice to provide a static variable for this."
msgstr ""

#: ../reusable.rst:80
msgid "We provide this in :file:`__init__.py`"
msgstr ""

#: ../reusable.rst:93
msgid "Using our permissions"
msgstr ""

#: ../reusable.rst:97
msgid "As you can see, we created two permissions, one for voting, one for viewing the votes."
msgstr ""

#: ../reusable.rst:99
msgid "If a user is not allowed to see the votes, she does not need access to the vote viewlet."
msgstr ""

#: ../reusable.rst:101
msgid "While we are at it, if a user can't vote, she needs no access to the helper view to actually submit a vote."
msgstr ""

#: ../reusable.rst:103
msgid "We can add this restriction to :file:`browser/configure.zcml`"
msgstr ""

#: ../reusable.rst:140
msgid "We are configuring components, so we use the component name of the permission, which is the :samp:`id` part of the declaration we added earlier."
msgstr ""

#: ../reusable.rst:144
msgid "So, what happens if we do not protect the browser view to vote?"
msgstr ""

#: ../reusable.rst:146
msgid "The person could still vote, by handcrafting the URL. Browser Views run code without any restriction, it is your job to take care of security."
msgstr ""

#: ../reusable.rst:148
msgid "But... if a person has no access to the object at all, maybe because the site is configured that Anonymous users cannot access private objects, the unauthorized users will not be able to submit a vote."
msgstr ""

#: ../reusable.rst:150
msgid "That is because Zope checks security permissions when trying to find the right object. If it can't find the object due to security constraints not met, no view ill ever be called, because that would have been the next step."
msgstr ""

#: ../reusable.rst:152
msgid "We now protect our views and viewlets. We still show the option to vote though."
msgstr ""

#: ../reusable.rst:154
msgid "We must add a condition in our page template, and we must provide the condition information in our viewlet class."
msgstr ""

#: ../reusable.rst:156
msgid "Lets move on to :file:`browser/viewlets.py`"
msgstr ""

#: ../reusable.rst:185
msgid "And the template in :file:`browser/templates/voting_viewlet.pt`"
msgstr ""

#: ../reusable.rst:216
msgid "Sometimes subtle bugs come up because of changes. In this case I noticed that I should only prompt people to vote if they are allowed to vote!"
msgstr ""

#: ../reusable.rst:221
msgid "Provide defaults"
msgstr ""

#: ../reusable.rst:225
msgid "Are we done yet? Who may vote now?"
msgstr ""

#: ../reusable.rst:227
msgid "We have to tell that someone."
msgstr ""

#: ../reusable.rst:229
msgid "Who has which permissions is managed in Zope. This is persistent, and persistent configuration is handled by GenericSetup."
msgstr ""

#: ../reusable.rst:231
msgid "The persistent configuration is managed in another file: :file:`profiles/default/rolemap.xml`"
