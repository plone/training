msgid "Marker Interfaces"
msgstr ""

#: ../dexterity_2.rst:29
msgid "The content-type `Talk` is not yet a first-class citizen because it does not implement his own interface. Interfaces are like name-tags, telling other elements who and what you are and what you can do. A marker interface is like such a nametag. The talks actually have a auto-generated marker-interface ``plone.dexterity.schema.generated.Plone_0_talk``."
msgstr ""

#: ../dexterity_2.rst:31
msgid "The problem is that the name of the Plone-instance ``Plone`` is part of that interface-name. If you now moved these types to a site with another name, code that uses these Interfaces would no longer find the objects in question."
msgstr ""

#: ../dexterity_2.rst:33
msgid "To solve this we add a new file ``interfaces.py``:"
msgstr ""

#: ../dexterity_2.rst:45

#: ../dexterity_2.rst:50
msgid "The first option has a important drawback: Only new talks would be instances of the new class. We would either have to migrate the existing talks or delete them."
msgstr ""

#: ../dexterity_2.rst:52
msgid "So lets register the interface as a behavior in ``behaviors/configure.zcml``"
msgstr ""

#: ../dexterity_2.rst:62
msgid "And enable it on the type in ``profiles/default/types/talk.xml``"
msgstr ""

msgid "Either reinstall the addon, apply the behavior by hand or run a upgrade-step (see below) and the interface will be there."
msgstr ""

msgid "Then we can safely bind the talkview to the new marker interface."
msgstr ""

#: ../dexterity_2.rst:91
msgid "Now the ``/talkview`` can only be used on objects that implement said interface. We can now also query the catalog for objects providing this interface ``catalog(object_provides=\"ploneconf.site.interfaces.ITalk\")``. The `talklistview` and the `demoview` do not get this constraint since they are not only used on talks."
