msgid "Marker Interfaces"
msgstr ""

#: ../dexterity_2.rst:33
msgid "The content type `Talk` is not yet a first class citizen because it does not implement its own interface. Interfaces are like nametags, telling other elements who and what you are and what you can do. A marker interface is like such a nametag. The talks actually have an auto-generated marker interface ``plone.dexterity.schema.generated.Plone_0_talk``."
msgstr ""

#: ../dexterity_2.rst:35
msgid "The problem is that the name of the Plone instance ``Plone`` is part of that interface name. If you now moved these types to a site with another name, code that uses these Interfaces would no longer find the objects in question."
msgstr ""

#: ../dexterity_2.rst:37
msgid "To solve this we add a new Interface to ``interfaces.py``:"
msgstr ""

#: ../dexterity_2.rst:58

#: ../dexterity_2.rst:63
msgid "The first option has an important drawback: Only new talks would be instances of the new class. We would either have to migrate the existing talks or delete them."
msgstr ""

#: ../dexterity_2.rst:65
msgid "So let's register the interface as a behavior in ``behaviors/configure.zcml``"
msgstr ""

#: ../dexterity_2.rst:75

msgstr ""

msgid "Either reinstall the addon, apply the behavior by hand or run an upgrade step (see below) and the interface will be there."
msgstr ""

msgid "Then we can safely bind the talkview to the new marker interface."
msgstr ""

#: ../dexterity_2.rst:104
msgid "Now the ``/talkview`` can only be used on objects that implement said interface. We can now also query the catalog for objects providing this interface ``catalog(object_provides=\"ploneconf.site.interfaces.ITalk\")``. The `talklistview` and the `demoview` do not get this constraint since they are not only used on talks."
