msgid "Using Annotations"
msgstr ""

#: ../behaviors2.rst:8
msgid "We are going to store the information in an annotation. Not because it is needed but because you will find code that uses annotations and need to understand the implications."
msgstr ""

#: ../behaviors2.rst:10
msgid "`Annotations`_ in Zope/Plone mean that data won't be stored directly on an object but in an indirect way and with namespaces so that multiple packages can store information under the same attribute, without colliding."
msgstr ""

#: ../behaviors2.rst:12
msgid "So using annotations avoids namespace conflicts. The cost is an indirection. The dictionary is persistent so it has to be stored separately. Also, one could give attributes a name containing a namespace prefix to avoid naming collisions."
msgstr ""

#: ../behaviors2.rst:22
msgid "Using Schema"
msgstr ""

#: ../behaviors2.rst:26
msgid "The attribute where we store our data will be declared as a schema field. We mark the field as a ommitted field, because we are not going to create z3c.form widgets for displaying them. We do provide a schema, because many other packages use the schema information to get knowledge of the relevant fields."
msgstr ""

#: ../behaviors2.rst:28
msgid "For example, when files have been migrated to blobs, new objects had to be created and every schema field was copied. The code can't know about our field, except if we provide schema information."
msgstr ""

#: ../behaviors2.rst:35
msgid "Writing Code"
msgstr ""

#: ../behaviors2.rst:37
msgid "To start, we create a directory :file:`behavior` with an empty :file:`behavior/__init__.py` file."
msgstr ""

#: ../behaviors2.rst:39
msgid "Next we must, as always, register our zcml."
msgstr ""

#: ../behaviors2.rst:41
msgid "First, add the information that there will be another zcml file in :file:`configure.zcml`"
msgstr ""

#: ../behaviors2.rst:56
msgid "Next, create :file:`behavior/configure.zcml`"
msgstr ""

#: ../behaviors2.rst:75
msgid "There are some important differences to our first behavior:"
msgstr ""

#: ../behaviors2.rst:77
msgid "There is a marker interface"
msgstr ""

#: ../behaviors2.rst:78
msgid "There is a factory"
msgstr ""

#: ../behaviors2.rst:82
msgid "The factory is a class that provides the behavior logic and gives access to the attributes we provide. Factories in Plone/Zope land are retrieved by adapting an object with an interface. If you want your behavior, you would write :samp:`IVoting(object)`"
msgstr ""

#: ../behaviors2.rst:86
msgid "But in order for this to work, your object may *not* be implementing the IVoting interface, because if it would, :samp:`IVoting(object)` would return the object itself! If I need a marker interface for objects providing my behavior, I must provide one, for this we use the marker attribute. My object implements :samp:`IVotable` and because of this, we can write views and viewlets just for this content type."
msgstr ""

#: ../behaviors2.rst:89
msgid "The interfaces need to be written, in our cases into a file :file:`interfaces.py`:"
msgstr ""

#: ../behaviors2.rst:165
msgid "This is a lot of code. The IVotableLayer we will need later for viewlets and browser views. Lets add it right here. The IVotable interface is the simple marker interface. It will only be used to bind browser views and viewlets to content types that provide our behavior, so no code needed."
msgstr ""

#: ../behaviors2.rst:168
msgid "The IVoting class is more complex, as you can see. While IVoting is just an interface, we use :samp:`plone.supermodel.model.Schema` for advanced dexterity features. Zope.schema provides no means for hiding fields. The directives :samp:`form.omitted` from :samp:`plone.autoform` allow us to annotate this additional information so that the autoform renderers for forms can use the additional information."
msgstr ""

#: ../behaviors2.rst:171
msgid "We make this omit conditional. If we run Plone in debug mode, we will be able to see the internal data in the edit form."
msgstr ""

#: ../behaviors2.rst:173
msgid "We create minimal schema fields for our internal data structures. For a small test, I removed the form omitted directives and opened the edit view of a talk that uses the behavior. After seeing the ugliness, I decided that I should provide at least  minimum of information. Titles and required are purely optional, but very helpful if the fields won't be omitted, something that can be helpful when debugging the behavior. Later, when we implement the behavior, the :samp:`votes` and :samp:`voted` attributes are implemented in such a way that you can't just modify these fields, they are read only."
msgstr ""

#: ../behaviors2.rst:176
msgid "Then we define the API that we are going to use in browser views and viewlets."
msgstr ""

#: ../behaviors2.rst:178
msgid "The last line ensures that the schema fields are known to other packages. Whenever some code wants all schemas from an object, he receives the schema defined directly on the object and the additional schemata. Additional schemata are compiled by looking for behaviors and whether they provide the :samp:`IFormFieldProvider` functionality. Only then we fields are known as schema fields."
msgstr ""

#: ../behaviors2.rst:180
msgid "Now the only thing that is missing is the behavior, which we must put into :file:`behavior/voting.py`"
msgstr ""

#: ../behaviors2.rst:215
msgid "In our :samp:`__init__` method we get *annotations* from the object. We look for data with a specific key."
msgstr ""

#: ../behaviors2.rst:218
msgid "The key in this example is the same as what I would get with :samp:`__name__+Vote.__name__`. But we won't create a dynamic name, this would be very clever and clever is bad."
msgstr ""

#: ../behaviors2.rst:220
msgid "By declaring a static name, we won't run into problems if we restructure the code."
msgstr ""

#: ../behaviors2.rst:222
msgid "You can see, that we initialize the data if it doesn't exist. We work with PersistentDict and PersistentList. To understand why we do this, it is important to understand how the ZODB works."
msgstr ""

#: ../behaviors2.rst:226
msgid "The ZODB can store objects. It has a special root object that you will never touch. Whatever you store where, will be part of the root object, except if it is an object sublclassing :samp:`persistent.Persistent` Then it will be stored independently."
msgstr ""

#: ../behaviors2.rst:228
msgid "Zope/ZODB Persistent objects note when you change an attribute on it and mark itself as changed. Changed objects will be saved to the database. This happens automatically. Each request begins a transaction and after our code ran and the Zope Server is preparing to send back the response we generated, the transaction will be committed and everything we changed will be saved."
msgstr ""

#: ../behaviors2.rst:230
msgid "Now, if have a normal dictionary on a persistent object, and you will only change the dictionary, the persistent object has no way to know, if the dictionary has been changed. This `happens`_ from time to time."
msgstr ""

#: ../behaviors2.rst:232
msgid "So one solution is to change the special attribute :samp:`_p_changed` to :samp:`True` on the persistent object, or to use a PersistentDict. That is what we are doing here."
msgstr ""

#: ../behaviors2.rst:234
msgid "You can find more information in the documentation of the ZODB, in particular `Rules for Persistent Classes <http://www.zodb.org/en/latest/documentation/guide/prog-zodb.html#rules-for-writing-persistent-classes>`_"
msgstr ""

#: ../behaviors2.rst:237
msgid "Next we provide the internal fields via properties. Using this form of property, makes them read only property, as we did not define write handlers. We don't need them so we won't add them."
msgstr ""

#: ../behaviors2.rst:239
msgid "As you have seen in the Schema declaration, if you run your site in debug mode, you will see an edit field for these fields. But trying to change these fields will throw an exception."
msgstr ""

#: ../behaviors2.rst:247
msgid "Lets continue with this file:"
msgstr ""

#: ../behaviors2.rst:297
msgid "We start with a little helper method which is not exposed via the interface. We don't want people to vote twice. There are many ways to ensure this and each one has flaws."
msgstr ""

#: ../behaviors2.rst:299
msgid "We chose this way to show you how to access information from the request the browser of the user sent to us. First, we get the ip of the user, then we access a small set of headers from the users browser and generate an md5 checksum of this."
msgstr ""

#: ../behaviors2.rst:301
msgid "The vote method, wants a vote and a request. We check the preconditions, then we convert the vote to an integer, store the request has to :samp:`voted` and the votes into the :samp:`votes` dictionary. We just count there, how often any vote has been given."
msgstr ""

#: ../behaviors2.rst:303
msgid "Everything else is just boring python."
