"You can extend the functionality of your dexterity object by writing an "
"adapter that adapts your dexterity object to add another feature or "
"aspect."
msgstr ""

#: ../behaviors_1.rst:27
msgid ""
"But if you want to use this adapter, you must somehow know that an object"
" implements that. Also, adding more fields to an object would not be easy"
" with such an approach."

msgid ""
"The name behavior is not a standard term in software development. But it "
"is a good idea to think of a behavior as an aspect. You are adding an "
"aspect to your content type and you want to write your aspect in such a "
"way that it works independently of the content type on which the aspect "
"is applied. You should not have dependencies to specific fields of your "
"object or to other behaviors."

"In the future, we want our presentation to be represented in Lanyrd (a "

"It can be a bit confusing when to use factories or marker interfaces and "

msgstr ""

#: ../behaviors_1.rst:88
msgid ""
"If you do not define a factory, your attributes will be stored directly "
"on the object. This can result in clashes with other behaviors."
msgstr ""

#: ../behaviors_1.rst:90
msgid ""
"You can avoid this by using the plone.behavior.AnnotationStorage factory."
" This one stores your attributes in an :ref:`Annotation "
"<plone:annotations>`. But then you *must* use a marker interface if you "
"want to have custom viewlets, browser views or portlets."

#: ../behaviors_1.rst:150
msgid ""
"We create a marker interface in :ref:`behaviors/social.py <social-"
"behavior-python-label>` for our behavior and make it also a schema "
"containing the fields we want to declare. We could just define schema "
"fields on a zope.intereface class, but we use an extended form from "
"`plone.supermodel`_, else we could not use the fieldset features."
