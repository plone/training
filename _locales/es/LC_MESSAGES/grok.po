"Grok is an alternative declaration language for declaring your "
"components. It is compatible with the Zope Component Architecture, it "
"used just an alternative syntax."

"Instead of writing separate zcml files, you annotate your code and you "
"create content conforming to specific file names so that they are "
"automatically found. There has been discussions whether grok should be "
"used in the plone core. The plone community decided against it, because "
"it increases the technology stack without adding functionality."

"Some people are even against using it in Add Ons, because there would not"
" be just one way to declare components, but two. Then there is onle last "
"disadvantage, grok components cannot be overridden by z3c.jbot. I would "
"not be surprised if this could be fixed though."

"After all these negative things let us tell you why we still like it: We "
"like to write as few lines of code and configuration as possible."

"So, we will write our browser view as a grok view. From the component "
"architecture side, nothing changes. We still need to write a multi "
"adapter. All the details like which template to use or for which browser "
"layer the view shall be used is declared with a single line annotation or"
" deduced from file names."

"Grok nearly magicaly does find all its annotations. Since its not "
"complete magic, you have to tell grok where to look for grok code. This "
"requires a single line of zcml, that line ensures that your complete "
"package is `grokked`."

"If we used ``grok`` for viewlets we would not need to register them in "
"the ``configure.zcml`` but do that in python. We would add a file "
"viewlets.py containing the viewlet-class."

#: ../grok.rst:83
msgid ""
"This would do the same as the coe above using grok's paradigm of "
"convention over configuration. In browser views the reference is called "
"view, note that in grok viewlets it is called viewlets (in that case "
"``viewlet/lanyrd_link``)."
