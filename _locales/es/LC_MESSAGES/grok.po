"Grok is an alternative declaration language for declaring your components. "
"It is compatible with the Zope Component Architecture, it used just an "
"alternative syntax."

"Instead of writing separate zcml files, you annotate your code and you "
"create content conforming to specific file names so that they are "
"automatically found. There has been discussions whether grok should be used "
"in the plone core. The plone community decided against it, because it "
"increases the technology stack without adding functionality."

"Some people are even against using it in Add Ons, because there would not be"
" just one way to declare components, but two. Then there is onle last "
"disadvantage, grok components cannot be overridden by z3c.jbot. I would not "
"be surprised if this could be fixed though."

"So, we will write our browser view as a grok view. From the component "
"architecture side, nothing changes. We still need to write a multi adapter. "
"All the details like which template to use or for which browser layer the "
"view shall be used is declared with a single line annotation or deduced from"
" file names."

"Grok nearly magicaly does find all its annotations. Since its not complete "
"magic, you have to tell grok where to look for grok code. This requires a "
