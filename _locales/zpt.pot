msgid "this results in:"
msgstr ""

#: ../zpt.rst:337
msgid "``tal:replace`` drops it's own base-tag in favor of the result of the TALES-expression. Thus the original ``<img... >`` is replaced. But the result is escaped by default."

msgid "And then wrap the code we want to put in the content-area of Plone in:"

msgstr ""

#: ../zpt.rst:418
msgid "The template should now look like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../zpt.rst:461
msgid "Since the demoview only used content from the template, not from the context that it is called on it makes little sense to have the edit-bar. We hide it by setting the respective variable on the current request with python to 1: ``request.set('disable_border', 1)``."
msgstr ""
