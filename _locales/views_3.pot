msgstr ""

#: ../views_3.rst:41
msgid "The catalog is like a search engine for the content on our site. It holds information about all the objects as well as some of their attributes like title, description, workflow_state, keywords that they were tagged with, author, content_type, its path in the site etc. But it does not hold the content of \"heavy\" fields like images or files, richtext fields and fields that we just defined ourselves."

msgid "Why use the catalog at all? It checks for permissions, and only returns the talks that the current user may see. They might be private or hidden to you since they are part of a top secret conference for core developers (there is no such thing!)."

#: ../views_3.rst:342
msgid "Afterwards you transform it into a listing. Here we use one of many nice features built into Plone. The ``class=\"pat-tablesorter\"`` (before Plone 5 that was ``class=\"listing\"``) gives the table a nice style and makes the table sortable with some javascript."

msgid "``tal:repeat=\"talk view/talks\"``"
msgstr ""

#: ../views_3.rst:389
msgid "This iterates over the list of dictionaries returned by the view. ``view/talks`` calls the method ``talks`` of our view and each ``talk`` is in turn one of the dictionaries that are returned by this method. Since TAL's path expressions for the lookup of values in dictionaries is the same as the attributes of objects we can write ``talk/somekey`` as we could ``view/somemethod``. Handy but sometimes irritating since from looking at the page template alone we often have no way of knowing if something is an attribute, a method or the value of a dict. It would be a good practice to write ``tal:repeat=\"talk python:view.talks()\"``."

msgid "Modify the view to only python expressions."
msgstr ""

msgid "Setting a custom view as default view on an object"

msgstr ""

#: ../views_3.rst:460
msgid "To make views configurable so that editors can choose them we have to register the view for the content type at hand in its FTI. To enable if for all folders we add a new file ``profiles/default/types/Folder.xml``"

msgid "We use METAL again but this time to fill a different slot. The \"javascript_head_slot\" is part of the html's ``<head>`` area in Plone and can be extended this way. We could also just put the code inline but having nicely ordered html is a good practice."

msgstr ""

#: ../views_3.rst:568
msgid "We add the ``jquery.datatables.js`` file directly to the HEAD slot of the HTML without using Plone JavaScript registry (portal_javascript).
