msgstr ""

#: ../viewlets_1.rst:49
msgid "This registers a viewlet called ``social``. It is visible on all content that implements the interface ``ISocial`` from our behavior. It is also good practice to bind it to the `BrowserLayer`_ ``IPloneconfSiteLayer`` of our addon so it only shows up if our addon is actually installed."

msgstr ""

#: ../viewlets_1.rst:72
msgid "If we used ``grok`` we would not need to register the viewlets in the ``configure.zcml`` but do that in python. We would add a file viewlets.py containing the viewlet-class."
msgstr ""

#: ../viewlets_1.rst:84
msgid "This would do the same as the coe above using grok's paradigm of convention over configuration. In browser views the reference is called view, note that in grok viewlets it is called viewlets (in that case ``viewlet/lanyrd_link``)."

#: ../viewlets_1.rst:115
msgid "In this example, :samp:`ISocial(self.context)` does return the context directly. It is still good to use this idiom for two reasons:"
msgstr ""

#: ../viewlets_1.rst:117
msgid "It makes it clear, that we only want to use the ISocial aspect of the object"
msgstr ""

#: ../viewlets_1.rst:118
msgid "If we decide to use a factory, for example to store our attributes in an annotation, we would `not` get back our context, but the adapter."
msgstr ""

#: ../viewlets_1.rst:120

msgid "Register a viewlet 'number_of_talks' in the footer that is only visible to admins (the permission you are looking for is ``cmf.ManagePortal``). Use only a template (no class) to display the number of talks already submitted. Hint: Use Aquisition to get the catalog (You know, you should not do this but there is plenty of code out there that does it...)"

msgid "For the ``for`` and ``layer``-parameters ``*`` is shorthand for ``zope.interface.Interface`` and the same effect as omitting them: The viewlet will be shown for all types of pages and for all Plone sites within your Zope instance."

msgid "Add the template :file:`browser/templates/number_of_talks.pt`:"
msgstr ""

#: ../viewlets_1.rst:176
msgid "``python:context.portal_catalog`` will return the catalog through Acquisition. Be carefull if you want to use path-expressions: ``content/portal_catalog`` calls the catalog (and returns all brains). You need to prevent this by using ``nocall:content/portal_catalog``."
msgstr ""

#: ../viewlets_1.rst:178
msgid "Relying on Acquisition is a bad idea. It would be much better to use the helper view ``plone_tools`` from ``plone/app/layout/globals/tools.py`` to get the catalog."
msgstr ""

#: ../viewlets_1.rst:188
msgid "``context/@@plone_tools/catalog`` traverses to the view ``plone_tools`` and calls it's method ``catalog``. In python it would look like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../viewlets_1.rst:199
msgid "It is not a good practice to query the catalog within a template since even simple logic like this should live in Python. But it is very powerful if you are debugging or need a quick and dirty solution."

msgid "Exercise 2"
msgstr ""

#: ../viewlets_1.rst:204
msgid "Register a viewlet 'days_to_conference' in the header. Use a class and a template to display the number of days until the conference. You get many bonus-points if you display it in a nice format (think \"In 2 days\" and \"Last Month\") by using an existing javascript or python library."
