msgid "This registers a viewlet called ``social``. It is visible on all content that implements the interface ``ISocial`` from our behavior. It is also good practice to bind it to a specific ``layer``, so it only shows up if our addon is actually installed.  We will return to this in a later chapter."

msgid "It makes it clear that we only want to use the ISocial aspect of the object"
msgstr ""

#: ../viewlets_1.rst:118
msgid "If we decide to use a factory, for example to store our attributes in an annotation, we would `not` get back our context, but the adapter."

msgid "Register a viewlet 'number_of_talks' in the footer that is only visible to admins (the permission you are looking for is ``cmf.ManagePortal``).

Hint: Use Acquisition to get the catalog (You know, you should not do this but there is plenty of code out there that does it...)"

msgid "``python:context.portal_catalog`` will return the catalog through Acquisition. Be careful if you want to use path expressions: ``content/portal_catalog`` calls the catalog (and returns all brains). You need to prevent this by using ``nocall:content/portal_catalog``."
msgstr ""

#: ../viewlets_1.rst:180
msgid "Relying on Acquisition is a bad idea. It would be much better to use the helper view ``plone_tools`` from ``plone/app/layout/globals/tools.py`` to get the catalog."

msgid "Register a viewlet 'days_to_conference' in the header. Use a class and a template to display the number of days until the conference. You get bonus points if you display it in a nice format (think \"In 2 days\" and \"Last Month\") by using either javascript or a python library."
