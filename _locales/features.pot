This user is often called \"zope root\" and is not managed in Plone but only by Zope. Therefore the user's missing some features like email and fullname and  won't be able to use some of plone's features. But the user has all possible permissions. As with the root user of a server, it's a bad practice to make unnecessary use of zope root. Use it to create Plone sites and their initial users, but not much else."

In either case, it may be undesirable for changes to be immediately visible."

msgid "Plone's ``Workflow Policy Support`` package gives you the ability to set different workflows in different sections of a site. Typically, you use it to set a special workflow in a folder that will govern everything under that folder. Since it has effect in a \"place\" in a site, this mechanism is often called \"Placeful Workflow\"."
msgstr ""
