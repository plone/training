msgid "Instead of writing separate zcml files, you annotate your code and you create content conforming to specific file names so that they are automatically found. There has been discussions whether grok should be used in the plone core. The plone community decided against it, because it increases the technology stack without adding functionality."

msgid "Some people are even against using it in Add Ons, because there would not be just one way to declare components, but two. Then there is onle last disadvantage, grok components cannot be overridden by z3c.jbot. I would not be surprised if this could be fixed though."

msgid "So, we will write our browser view as a grok view. From the component architecture side, nothing changes. We still need to write a multi adapter. All the details like which template to use or for which browser layer the view shall be used is declared with a single line annotation or deduced from file names."
