msgid "Before Zope, there usually was an Apache server that would call a script and give the request as an input. The script would then just print HTML to the standard output. Apache returned that to the user. Opening database connections, checking permission constraints, generating valid HTML, configuring caching, interpreting form data and everything you have to do on your own. When the second request comes in, you have to do everything again."

msgid "Jim Fulton thought that this was slightly tedious. So he wrote code to handle requests. He believed that site content is object-oriented and that the URL should somehow point directly into the object hierarchy, so he wrote an object-oriented database, called `ZODB <http://www.zodb.org/en/latest/>`_."

msgid "Acquisition is a kind of magic. Imagine a programming system where you do not access the file system and where you do not need to import code. You work with objects. An object can be a folder that contains more objects, an HTML page, data, or another script. To access an object, you need to know where the object is. Objects are found by paths that look like URLs, but without the domain name. Now Acquisition allows you to write an incomplete path. An incomplete path is a relative path, it does not explicitly state that the path starts from the root, it starts relative to where the code object is. If Zope cannot resolve the path to an object relative to your code, I tries the same path in the containing folder. And then the folder containing the folder."

Imagine you want to have header images differing for each section of your page, sometimes even differing for a specific subsection of your site. So you define a path header_image and put a header image at the root of your site. If you want a folder to with a different header image, you put the header image into this folder. Please take a minute to let this settle and think, what this allows you to do."
