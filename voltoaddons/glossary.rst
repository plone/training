Glossary
--------

- Volto project - the product of running ``create-volto-app``, a customizable
  instance of Volto

- Volto addon: a JS package that integrates with Volto's configuration registry

- Addon configuration loader: a function with signature ``config => config``.

- Volto configuration registry: a singleton object modeled using JS modules,
  accessible from the Volto project using the ``~/config`` path.

- Razzle: a tool that simplifies SPA and SSR configuration for ReactJS
  projects.

- Webpack: we tool that loads and bundles code and web resources using loaders

- Webpack entrypoint: the main files generated by webpack as a result. They
  typically contain the application source code based on modules bundled
  together, but it can also include other resources, such as static resources.
  It can contain code to automatically trigger the load of other JS code files
  called "chunks"

- Babel: a Javascript compiler that "transpiles" newer standards JS to
  something that any browser can load.

- Express: a Javascript HTTP server with a simple API to build custom
  applications. Volto uses it as its server.

- Server-Side Rendering (SSR): when first loading any Plone page, users will get HTML
  markup that closely matches the final DOM structure of the react components
  used to render that page

- Single Page Application (SPA): a type of Javascript application that aims to
  provide a better user experience by avoiding unnecessary reloading of the
  browser page, instead uses AJAX to load backend information

- Hot Module Replacement (HMR): a development feature provided by Webpack that
  automatically reloads, in the browser, the JS modules that have changed

- Yeoman: a popular scaffolding tool similar to Plone's mr.bob or ZopeSkel

- CommonJS: a Javascript package standard, the equivalent of a Python wheel or
  egg. Enables Javascript modules.

- Transpilation: the transformation of Javascript code that uses advanced
  language features, unavailable for some browsers, to code rewritten to
  support them.

- ES6 - ECMAScript 6, a newer version of the Javascript language.

- mrs-developer: Also called "missdev", a tool similar to buildout's
  mr.developer, automatically downloads and keeps up to date copies of software
  and addons under development based on definitions stored in
  ``mrs.developer.json``. As a byproduct of its update operations, it also
  automatically adjusts ``jsconfig.json``, which is used by Volto to configure
  webpack aliases.

- Shadowing: webpack provides an "alias" mechanism, where the path for
  a module can be aliased to another module. By using this mechanism Volto
  enables customization (file overrides), similar to z3c.jbot

- Yarn: a popular Javascript package manager similar to NPM.
