> I have been a web developer since the turn of the millennium, primarily
> as a Zope and Plone developer. That didn't stop me from working on projects
> with Pyramid, VueJS, Tensorflow, Django, Ruby on Rails, Linked Data and XML
> techologies such as XSLT and XQuery. Lately I've set everything aside to
> make room for Volto.
>
> If there's one thing I can say about Volto is that I'm in awe with it and
> the vision of its initial designers and developers. The fact that it
> exists, the craziness of even thinking about starting this project with
> just a dream and limited resources, this is something that has my deepest
> respect. Sure, it may not be perfect and there's plenty to improve, but it
> has all the qualities that made Plone great from the start: it opens
> a world of possibilities that didn't exist before and most important, it's
> useful right now.
