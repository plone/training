Write Your Own Add-Ons to Customize Plone
=========================================

.. sidebar:: Get the code!

    Get the code for this chapter (:doc:`More info <sneak>`) using this command in the buildout directory:

    .. code-block:: bash

        cp -R src/ploneconf.site_sneak/chapters/01_eggs1_p5/ src/ploneconf.site

.. _eggs1-create-label:


In this part you will:

* Create a custom python distribution ``ploneconf.site`` to hold all the code
* Modify buildout to install that distribution


Topics covered:

* mr.bob and bobtemplates.plone
* the structure of eggs


Creating the distribution
-------------------------

Our own code has to be organized as a python distribution, also called *egg*. An egg is a zip file or a directory that follows certain conventions. We are going to use `bobtemplates.plone <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bobtemplates.plone>`_ to create a skeleton project. We only need to fill in the blanks.

We create and enter the ``src`` directory (*src* is short for *sources*) and call a script called ``mrbob`` from our buildout's bin directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mkdir src      # (if src does not exist already)
    $ cd src
    $ ../bin/mrbob -O ploneconf.site bobtemplates:plone_addon

We have to answer some questions about the add-on. We will press :kbd:`Enter` (i.e. choosing the default value) for all questions except 3 (where you enter your github username if you have one) and 5 (Plone version), where we enter :kbd:`5.0`::

    --> What kind of package would you like to create? Choose between 'Basic', 'Dexterity', and 'Theme'. [Basic]:

    --> Author's name [Philip Bauer]:

    --> Author's email [bauer@starzel.de]:

    --> Author's github username: fulv

    --> Package description [An add-on for Plone]:

    --> Plone version [4.3.6]: 5.0.5

    Generated file structure at /vagrant/buildout/src/ploneconf.site

.. only:: not presentation

    If this is your first egg, this is a very special moment. We are going to create the egg with a script that generates a lot of necessary files. They all are necessary, but sometimes in a subtle way. It takes a while to understand their full meaning. Only last year I learned and understood why I should have a ``MANIFEST.in`` file. You can get along without one, but trust me, you get along better with a proper manifest file.


.. _eggs1-inspect-label:

Inspecting the distribution
---------------------------

In ``src`` there is now a new folder ``ploneconf.site`` and in there is the new distribution. Let's have a look at some of the files:

bootstrap-buildout.py, buildout.cfg, travis.cfg, .travis.yml, .coveragerc
    You can ignore these files for now. They are here to create a buildout only for this egg to make testing it easier. Once we start writing tests for this distribution we will have another look at them.

README.rst, CHANGES.rst, CONTRIBUTORS.rst, docs/
    The documentation, changelog, the list of contributors and the license of your egg goes in here.

setup.py
    This file configures the distribution, its name, dependencies and some metadata like the author's name and email address. The dependencies listed here are automatically downloaded when running buildout.

src/ploneconf/site/
    The distribution itself lives inside a special folder structure. That seems confusing but is necessary for good testability. Our distribution contains a `namespace package <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0420/>`_ called *ploneconf.site* and because of this there is a folder ``ploneconf`` with a ``__init__.py`` and in there another folder ``site`` and in there finally is our code.
    From the buildout's perspective our code is in ``<your buildout directory>/src/ploneconf.site/src/ploneconf/site/<real code>``


.. note::

    Unless discussing the buildout we will from now on silently omit these folders when describing files and assume that ``<your buildout directory>/src/ploneconf.site/src/ploneconf/site/`` is the root of our distribution!


configure.zcml (src/ploneconf/site/configure.zcml)
    The phone book of the distribution. By reading it you can find out which functionality is registered though the component architecture.

setuphandlers.py (src/ploneconf/site/setuphandlers.py)
    This holds code that is automatically run when installing and uninstalling our add-on.

interfaces.py (src/ploneconf/site/interfaces.py)
    Here a browserlayer is defined in a straightforward python class. We will need it later.

testing.py
    This holds the setup for running tests.

tests/
    This holds the tests.

browser/
    This directory is a python package (because it has a ``__init__.py``) and will by convention hold most things that are visible in the browser.

browser/configure.zcml
    The phonebook of the browser package. Here views, resources and overrides are registered.

browser/overrides/
    This add-on is already configured to allow overriding existing default Plone templates.

browser/static/
    A directory that holds static resources (images/css/js). The files in here will be accessible through URLs like ``++resource++ploneconf.site/myawesome.css``

profiles/default/
    This folder contains the GenericSetup profile. During the training we will put some xml files here that hold configuration for the site.

profiles/default/metadata.xml
    Version number and dependencies that are auto-installed when installing our add-on.

..    profiles/uninstall/
      This folder holds another GenericSetup profile. The steps in here are executed on uninstalling.


.. _eggs1-include-label:

Including the distribution in Plone
-----------------------------------

Before we can use our new distribution we have to tell Plone about it. Edit ``buildout.cfg`` and uncomment ``ploneconf.site`` in the sections `auto-checkout`, `eggs` and `test`:

.. code-block:: cfg
    :emphasize-lines: 4, 32, 40

    auto-checkout +=
        ploneconf.site_sneak
    #    starzel.votable_behavior
        ploneconf.site

    parts =
        checkversions
        codeintel
        instance
        mrbob
        packages
        robot
        test
        zopepy

    eggs =
        Plone
        Pillow

    # development tools
        z3c.jbot
        plone.api
        plone.reload
        Products.PDBDebugMode
        plone.app.debugtoolbar
        Products.PrintingMailHost

    # TTW Forms (based on Archetypes)
        Products.PloneFormGen

    # The add-on we develop in the training
        ploneconf.site

    # Voting on content
    #    starzel.votable_behavior

    zcml =

    test-eggs +=
        ploneconf.site [test]

This tells Buildout to add the egg ``ploneconf.site``. The sources for this eggs are defined in the section `[sources]` at the bottom of `buildout.cfg`.

.. code-block:: cfg
   :emphasize-lines: 2

   [sources]
   ploneconf.site = fs ploneconf.site path=src
   # ploneconf.site = fs final full-path=src/ploneconf.site_sneak/chapters/final
   starzel.votable_behavior = git https://github.com/collective


The definition tells buildout not to download it from pypi, and expect it in ``src/ploneconf.site``. This is done with the directive *fs*, which allows you to add eggs on the filesystem without a version control system.

Now run buildout to reconfigure Plone with the updated configuration:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ./bin/buildout

After restarting Plone with ``./bin/instance fg`` the new add-on `ploneconf.site` is available for install like PloneFormGen or Plone True Gallery.

We will not install it now since we did not add any of our own code or configuration yet. Let's do that next.
