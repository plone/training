Buildout II: Getting Ready for Deployment
=========================================


.. _deployment-starzel-label:

The Starzel buildout
--------------------

Have a look at the buildout some of the trainers use for their projects: https://github.com/starzel/buildout

It has some notable features:

* It extends to config- and version-files on github shared by all projects that use the same version of Plone:

  .. code-block:: cfg

      [buildout]
      extends =
          https://raw.githubusercontent.com/starzel/buildout/5.0.5/linkto/base.cfg

* It allows to update a project simply by changing the version it extends.
* It allows to update all projects of one version by changing remote files (very useful for HotFixes).
* It is minimal work to setup a new project.
* It has presets for development, testing, staging and production.
* It has all the nice development-helpers we use.

Another noteable buildout to look for inspiration:
